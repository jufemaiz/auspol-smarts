              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House express its deep regret at the death on 8 December 2011 of the Right Honourable Sir Zelman Cowen AK, GCMG, GCVO, QC, a former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1977 to 1982, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 8 December 2011 Australia lost one of its greatest statesmen with the death of our nation's 19th Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen. Born in 1919, Sir Zelman grew up in the marvellous Melbourne of the 1920s where he had two of the finest role models an imaginative and impressionable young boy could have—John Monash and Isaac Isaacs. Like them, he enjoyed the transformative experience of a superb education which took him, as it carried them, to the very summit of achievement and success. Like them, he united innate ability with extraordinary application and hard work, but it was not all seriousness and study. Sir Zelman wrote movingly about long afternoons at the beach, the cricket or the movies, or watching his beloved St Kilda unsuccessfully fight for a flag. It was a very Australian life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman was awarded a Rhodes scholarship in 1940, which he deferred until 1945 so that he could complete his war service with the Royal Australian Navy. He went on to become a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and returned to Australia in 1951 as professor and dean of law at the University of Melbourne, where he was to remain for 16 years. Vice-chancellorships of the University of New England and the University of Queensland followed in what were dramatic years for university leaders around the world. On Bastille Day 1977 came the unexpected but very welcome announcement that Professor Zelman Cowen would be Australia's next Governor-General. It was one of Malcolm Fraser's finest decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman came to office when the role of Governor-General and the fabric of our political system had been placed under enormous duress. He rightly identified the need for a touch of healing and, through his wisdom and dignity, delivered it. The healing continued throughout his 4½ years as Governor-General where he sought to interpret the nation to itself and recognised those whose voice was not always heard. There have been just 25 governors-general since the advent of Australian nationhood in 1901. None has served with more distinction than Sir Zelman Cowen. He set the template for all of his successors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman's long list of honours and achievements could not alone define him. He was a loving and much loved husband and father, and we are honoured today by the presence in the gallery of Lady Cowen—you are very welcome here—and Sir Zelman's son, Rabbi Cowen. Thank you for being among our number.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms GILLARD:</span>
                  </a>  Sir Zelman was a man of enormous warmth and humour, a music lover and patron of the arts, a humanitarian dedicated to justice and public welfare, a proud member of the Australian community, a proud member of the Jewish community and a leader of both, but above all Sir Zelman Cowen was a good and decent man, open-minded, tolerant and wise. To put it simply, he was a gentleman. I am not sure these terms would have sat well with Sir Zelman because his way was understated and humble. Serving his country, whether in the Navy, as a teacher, an administrator or a viceroy was not a chore; it was an honour. He always understood public service as a vocation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we measure a life by the void it leaves, then Sir Zelman Cowen's passing has left our nation with a large gap indeed, but the strength of his legacy ensures that it endures in all those whose lives he touched—in his wife and great support, Anna, and his children and grandchildren, in all of the young people he mentored who now adorn the public life of our country, including the member for Kooyong, and in all those who felt included and inspired by his generosity of spirit during that time of healing. If there was one regret it was the fact that St Kilda never won another flag after that miraculous one-point victory in 1966, held on the Festival of Yom Kippur. The Saints are among many who have mourned the loss of a friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A life like this deserves to be remembered not only in our hearts but also through institutional means that will endure. Already there is the Sir Zelman Cowen Centre at Victoria University in Melbourne and the Sir Zelman Cowen Trust Fund for Australians studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Since Sir Zelman's passing, there have been a number of new proposals for the recognition of his work. Among these is a scholarship proposed by the General Sir John Monash Foundation to honour Sir Zelman's profound contribution to the law, academia, government and the nation. The government will create such scholarships, working with the foundation. The aim would be to create a prestigious award that would enable further study overseas at the highest level. This would be most appropriate, mirroring the life-changing nature of Sir Zelman's own studies overseas. It is also appropriate because the nation should remember. And we will remember.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman once wrote that his old friend, the American jurist Erwin Griswold, had led a great, a distinguished and an honourable life. He could have been writing about himself. Sir Zelman was indeed a great, distinguished and honourable man. We were enriched by his life and are diminished by his passing. He will be long remembered and very greatly missed. On behalf of the government and the people of Australia, I extend to Lady Cowen and her family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:08</span>):  I rise to support the fine words of the Prime Minister and to observe that Sir Zelman Cowen's life was one of remarkable achievement and enduring benefit to our country. He was, in turn, a Rhodes Scholar, a naval officer and survivor of the bombing of Darwin, an academic, a vice chancellor, a viceroy, the head of an Oxford college, the head of an important regulator and the chairman of one of our most important public companies. He was truly great and he was truly good, and our country is deeply in his debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman appreciated the continuities of our culture but he well understood that often things have to change in order to last. To give just one example, he found Oriel College, Oxford to be the last bastion of single-sex education and he left it as part of the 20th century as a mixed college. Sir Zelman knew when to speak and he knew when to hold his peace. As Governor-General he delivered literally thousands of elegant speeches on almost every subject, but not once did he comment on the dismissal of a prime minister by his predecessor, famously saying that no good purpose would come of answering questions on that subject. It was indeed through his judicious silences that he successfully brought about this vital touch of healing to the highest office in our land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman was very conscious of his Jewish heritage, although he was not especially religious, as his son Shimon so eloquently pointed out at his funeral service in Melbourne. Sir Zelman was a seeker after truth rather than an expounder of dogma. Perhaps one way in which we could further honour his memory is by seeking the ethical principles which might be regarded as common to all cultures and to all people—principles such as keeping commitments, respecting human life and caring for the vulnerable. Sir Zelman sought always the things men and women had in common and hoped always that they might be their best selves. We miss him, we honour him, we seek to be worthy of him and we extend our condolences to Lady Anna and his family.</span>

Isaacs was also the first Jewish Governor-General. Sir Zelman did not imagine that 10 years after the biography was published the Prime Minister would ask him to follow in Isaacs' footsteps and in doing so become Australia's second Jewish Governor-General. Sir Zelman, speaking of the moment at which Malcolm Fraser proposed to him that he should be the successor to Sir John Kerr, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Among the thoughts that crowded into my mind was the one that it was an extraordinary thing that I should have been a biographer of Isaacs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman described his appointment as Governor-General, and service from 1977 to 1982, as 'totally unexpected, but it was the greatest experience of my life'. We are all the beneficiaries of his service to our country. At a media conference after his appointment was announced Sir Zelman was asked what he hoped to do. He said, as always with simple and carefully chosen words:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much of the coverage of Sir Zelman's passing has referred to his healing role in restoring Australians' confidence in the Governor-Generalship, much needed after the involvement of Sir John Kerr in the sacking of the Whitlam government. Some have suggested that Sir Zelman became such a successful Governor-General because he avoided partisanship, but in no sense did he avoid the great issues of public affairs during his life. Sir Zelman had strong, carefully reasoned and clearly expressed views on those issues. He commented frequently in speeches, on radio and on television, opposing the Communist Party dissolution referendum in 1951, opposing capital punishment and the Victorian hangings in the 1960s and defending free speech and the right to protest in the early 1970s. In the 1990s he came to support an Australian republic because he believed the nation was ready for it. He spoke on asylum seekers during the Howard government and his words show us the wonderful man that he was. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I consider that being as generous as we can is the most likely way to get the best result. My background gives me a sense of a powerful urge to find something better. Compared to many nations in the world our circumstances are comfortable, even enviable. We have, I think, an obligation as part of the international community to behave with magnanimity to those who arrive here carrying little else but their hopes for a better life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman's life was a life of service, both before and after his Governor-Generalship. He served our country in the Navy in World War II. He became the Dean at the Melbourne Law School at 31 and served in that role from 1951 to 1966. He continued to serve the cause of higher education for the rest of his life in the formal roles of Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland and Provost of Oriel College, and in countless other roles. I am very pleased to hear the Prime Minister's announcement of the establishment of scholarships in Sir Zelman's name through the General Sir John Monash Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Zelman was a great participant in the Jewish community. I saw him from time to time at Temple Beth Israel in Melbourne, the synagogue where his father Bernard was president, the synagogue where in 1945 he married Anna, who is with us here today, and the synagogue where his state funeral was held on 13 December 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He often attended Jewish community events and was always ready to assist the community. Just in August last year he provided a well-written message for the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission for its fundraising appeal, which included, as so often from Sir Zelman, his care for the future. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We must educate both the youth of our own community and the next generation of Australians to know that racism and anti-Semitism must never be tolerated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to visit Sir Zelman on a Saturday afternoon in July 2010 with Irwin Cotler, a current member of the Canadian parliament and former Attorney-General of Canada but also an eminent professor of constitutional and human rights law—someone with a very long association with Sir Zelman. Sir Zelman was watching the football on TV, following another of his passions, the St Kilda Football Club—a passion I regrettably share, because it has meant mostly disappointment since 1966. He interrupted watching the game to immediately engage with his visitors on issues of the day in Canada and in Australia. That was the Sir Zelman I knew, late in his life, always engaging in matters of public concern and still seeking to serve in whatever way he could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">State funerals do not always capture the essence of the public figure they honour but Sir Zelman's funeral was an exception. There were deeply moving eulogies from Rabbi John Levi; from Sir Zelman's son, Rabbi Shimon Cowen, who is also here with us; from Dr Donald Markwell, the Warden of Rhodes House, University of Oxford; from Steven Skala AO; and from the member for Kooyong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Levi spoke from the ancient teachings of the three crowns—the crown of learning, the crown of priesthood or faith and the crown of royalty, all of which Sir Zelman bore—and of a fourth crown, the crown of a good name, which excels them all. Steven Skala said, rightly and eloquently, in words that I cannot improve on, that Sir Zelman's 'life's work in public and private reflected the deepest concern for the dignity of every person', that 'he embedded in us a love of learning, the pursuit of ideas and the power of reason in achieving justice, simply by being who he was', and that 'to understand Sir Zelman Cowen is to understand that the public man and the private man were the same: humane, decent, civil, loyal and committed to helping'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I end with some more of Sir Zelman's own words from his memoirs, reflecting on something that he used to say at citizenship ceremonies—all of us in this House speak at these ceremonies and we all seek to capture in our different ways something of the spirit of our nation. Sir Zelman drew on the background that he shared with Isaacs. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On occasion, when I spoke at citizenship ceremonies, I would recount the story of Isaacs, the son of poor immigrants, who had arrived in Australia only a year before my birth. I could reflect that my own story, while different in some respects, was not so very different, and I said that I believed that this should carry a message to those who participants in such ceremonies, and who could see the evidence of great human opportunity in such life stories. We have reason to be very proud of a country which makes this possible and actual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have reason to be very proud of our country, but we also have reason to be very proud of Sir Zelman Cowen, a truly great Australian. We mourn his passing and we will miss him.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="0J4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RUDDOCK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:19</span>):  I commend those who have spoken before me for their very wise and well-chosen words. I believe I am the only member of this House who served while Sir Zelman was Governor-General of Australia. I had the opportunity of meeting with him on numerous occasions but I also had the opportunity of meeting with him afterwards at Oriel College, when he had retired from the role of Governor-General and had taken up a fresh academic appointment. I was there quite uniquely, in a sense, with members of the parliament at that time but also with George Brandis of the Senate, Don Markwell and Tom Harley—all distinguished Liberals who have written on that topic and were at Sir Zelman's feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has been regaled as the great healer. I think it is important to recognise the nature of the events in 1975 for the potential they had to do the Australian democracy enormous harm. We came from those events, notwithstanding those challenges, in a cohesive way. It is by no accident that Sir Zelman Cowen is regaled as the healer, the person who was able to provide very considered leadership in addressing those important issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my own part, I want to simply record that I saw Sir Zelman Cowen as a great Australian, regardless of whether he had been Governor-General or not. To be appointed as a professor of public law and Dean of the Melbourne Law School at the age of 31 years was remarkable in itself. He had been a visiting professor at American universities. Before that time he played a very significant role in modernising legal education. He focused on assimilating legal education with practice. He advised the British Colonial Office on constitutional matters as a dominion liaison officer. He advised governments of Hong Kong and China on legal affairs. It can be seen that even before his leadership roles at the University of New England and as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Queensland his achievements were very considerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One matter that has not been noted was that between 1976 and 1977 he was appointed a Law Reform Commissioner and was active in the areas of addressing the need for the law to keep up to date with the times during mass globalisation and of updating law to deal with rapid development in science and technology sectors such as bioethics and, specifically, human transplants and privacy. Later his activities led to the introduction of the federal Privacy Act. I thought it was particularly germane that Michael Kirby wrote of him:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While still Vice Chancellor of the University of Queensland, he agreed to serve with me in the Australian Law Reform Commission. And he did so between 1976 and 1977. What exciting days they were. Two of our projects have grown out his own academic interests. One of them, for the protection of privacy, led to the federal Privacy Act and resulted in my own introduction to the international activities of committees of the OECD. The other concerned bioethics, specifically human tissue transplants. Zelman had also written on the topic. He once let me into his intellectual secret. He urged me to read American law reviews which, he said, would put me ten years ahead of most Australian lawyers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Kirby said he took his advice. Others may not comment as positively on those matters, but I thought it was of interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my remarks by picking up one of the observations of a former Speaker and member for Isaacs. He commented on Sir Zelman having some observations to make about an Australian republic. I conclude with what he had to say about that matter in 1999 when speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He went on to take issue with those who argued for a direct election of a President. He preferred the method offered in a referendum beginning with a public nomination process and ending with a person put forward by the Prime Minister receiving bipartisan support from two-thirds of the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might say his comments were particularly perspicacious then and they may at another time be perspicacious again. I am pleased to be associated with this motion of condolence. I regard Sir Zelman as one of the greatest Australians that I have had the pleasure of knowing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:25</span>):  Sir Zelman Cowen was a second generation Australian. He was born Zelman Cohen in Melbourne in 1919 to a family originally from Belarus, then part of tsarist Russia. Originally from Ballarat, the Cohen family lived in St Kilda, even then a Melbourne suburb with a significant Jewish population. His father was variously employed as a car salesman and manager of an oil company and changed the family surname by deed poll to Cowen in 1922. Like so many of us, he was guided by his mother Sara, who, by his own admission, had strong ambitions for her son, which I would say he more than amply fulfilled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of his national and international repute, Sir Zelman Cowen was a St Kilda man at heart and never forgot the suburb where he was born—a suburb which I am proud, obviously, to represent in this parliament. He never forgot his boyhood on the streets of inner-city Melbourne and his immigrant heritage, as the member for Isaacs so aptly referred to earlier. In his autobiography, Sir Zelman recalls his first day at St Kilda Park Primary School, looking at the blackboard and thinking he would never make sense of what was there. Well, he did, of course, and more than most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege at the end of 2011, just prior to his funeral, of dedicating brand new extensions to St Kilda Park Primary School, just around the corner from my electoral office in Melbourne Ports. I noted the dedication of Sir Zelman Cowen as the school's most distinguished alumni. I know Sir Zelman would have approved of these extensions. His wife, Lady Anna Cowen, told me quite movingly at lunch that, while he was Governor-General, he was actually counted out—Sir Ninian Stephen took the role as his replacement while he was doing his last function at St Kilda Park Primary School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friends from the Chabad movement and his son, Rabbi Shimon Cowen, would probably think it is, as they say, beshert—ordained—that that very morning, in a function that was organised long before his death, I would go there to make those extensions and then walk from there to Temple Beth Israel to his funeral service. St Kilda Park Primary School has had many distinguished alumni, including the great cricketers Ponsford, Miller and Johnson, and Sir William Dargie, who won eight Archibald Prizes. But Sir Zelman is the school's most distinguished alumni.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a Saints man because the Junction Oval was just across the road, and he was their No. 1 supporter and patron. Lady Cowen very proudly showed me his life membership tag at lunch. Sir Zelman could never be called inconsistent in his lifelong support of the Saints and, until recently, attended St Kilda games. I remember attending one very memorable and sad one with him in the Long Room some years ago against Melbourne. On the Saints football club's obituary page for Sir Zelman, the team has posted a particularly apt and charming photo of Sir Zelman smiling with delight with that great character of Aussie Rules football Kevin 'Cowboy' Neale, who kicked five goals in the 1966 grand final. Perhaps our team, St Kilda, could benefit by inscribing what sometimes was stated in Sir Zelman's philosophy of life: 'the next thing and the next thing'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had many experiences with Sir Zelman over the decade since I became active in student politics—including with Steven Skala, who is present in the chamber with the family and Sir Zelman's son Nick—perhaps most memorably during the republic debate, on which the member for Berowra accurately cited Sir Zelman's view in favour of a parliamentary system of electing an Australian head of state. My most memorable encounter with Sir Zelman involved learning about Australian history. One day we fell into deep conversation about the Japanese attack on Darwin, which he was present at as a young naval intelligence officer. He explained to me that perhaps Australians were not quite as brave and as fearless as some of us would like to imagine and that history is perhaps more complicated than we realised. He and Australian naval intelligence played a great role in the defeat of the Japanese naval forces through the signals they sent for the crucial Battle of Midway. Sir Zelman rightly enters the pantheon of great Australians of the character of Monash and Sir Isaac Isaacs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  Zelman Cowen was a giant of a man. His record of achievement as a legal scholar, educator and public intellectual has few parallels in Australian life. As our nation's 19th Governor-General, he set a standard that is the benchmark for all those who have followed. His reputation was impeccable, based on a life lived with honesty and integrity to a degree that is seldom found. Sir Zelman's life and work won equal plaudits from both sides of the political divide. He was always above the rancour of partisanship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was the private man who was so special to those who had the privilege of knowing him. He was humane and decent, humble yet proud. One could not find a more loyal and caring friend, deeply interested as he was in the wellbeing of others. He mentored many of the young people who gravitated into his orbit. Each sought his wisdom and advice, which were always dispensed with a generosity of spirit. Age was no barrier to friendship with Sir Zelman for he would elevate you to his level, making you feel comfortable in his presence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I vividly remember my first meeting with him, nearly two decades ago, when his humour and wit quickly put this young boy at ease. He never needed to demand respect or command obedience but, by virtue of his very nature and being, he simply earned it. Right to the very end of his life, including the day of his passing, I and many others like me listened intently to his every word, knowing we were in the presence of greatness. He was an example and an inspiration and it is through those whom he mentored and his extended family that his legacy will live on. Sir Zelman's intellectual brilliance and firm moral compass were equally matched by a deep sense of his own identity. It is said that to know where you are going you have to know where you come from. Sir Zelman knew this. He was proud of his immigrant background and his Jewish faith and he never sought to distance himself from his heritage during his long and distinguished career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a devoted family man and one-half of a 66-year-long perfect marriage. Lady Anna Cowen, who is with us in the chamber today, is brilliant in her own right and was the source of much of Sir Zelman's strength. As Governor-General, the touch of healing he brought to the nation was equally hers. His love for Anna knew no bounds and I am not the first to say that, barring a small issue of Jewish tradition, she would be a saint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking back at Sir Zelman's life, it is as if he were destined for greatness from the very beginning, born as he was on the day Alfred Deakin died. As a schoolboy he knew he had special talents and at every step of the way he brought them to bear. He was always grateful for the opportunities that fell his way, describing himself as the most favoured of mortals. It is our nation's good fortune that such a gifted and principled man devoted his life to public service. We are all saddened by his passing but can be proud of his legacy and the many lives he has touched. I am proud to have called such a great Australian my friend.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:36</span>):  On a matter of an entirely different nature and one that is a cause for celebration amongst those of us gathered here today, I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That an Address of Congratulation be presented to Her Majesty The Queen, as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Your Majesty. We, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, express to Your Majesty our warm congratulations at this time of celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of your accession to the Throne. We express our respect and regard for the dedication you have displayed in the service of the Commonwealth and your deep and abiding commitment to Australia and her people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Australia became a federation in 1901, we have had just six monarchs. And for more than half of those 111 years there has been only one:    Elizabeth II, whose accession to the throne 60 years ago we honour in this sitting today. As third in line to the throne behind her uncle and father, the young Elizabeth was never expected to become Queen. But with the abdication in 1936 the 10-year-old princess became heir to a mighty empire. Even then, Princess Elizabeth could reasonably have expected decades of time to prepare for her future role as sovereign. But it was not to be. Her father, George VI, died at just 56, exhausted by illness and the accumulated stresses of the abdication and the war years. So today, as we honour the Diamond Jubilee, we also join Her Majesty in remembering a good king.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 6 February 1952, the Queen took over the burden carried by her father: the task of guiding a nation through the painful work of postwar reconstruction; of adapting the monarchy to a new, less formal era; and of addressing the needs of an empire impatient for change. From the beginning, she never appeared troubled by the burdens of office. Indeed, her very first decision set the course for all that was to follow. She was in Kenya when she heard the news of her father’s death and, even whilst coming to terms with that news and all that it meant in those most difficult of circumstances, when asked what name she would take she answered quickly and calmly: ‘My own, of course.’ It was the crisp, practical, no-nonsense approach we have all come to know and admire—an approach which also embraced, and perhaps sometimes hid, a warm and generous heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia, the 60 years of Queen Elizabeth’s reign have been years of remarkable evolution for our society and our economy. The Australia of 1952 was a small agricultural nation whose fortunes were tied to its traditional trading partners on the other side of the world. Her Majesty has seen us grow to be the robust, dynamic multicultural country which proudly takes its place in the Asian region and on the world stage. It has also been a period of remarkable political evolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we recognise the monarch as Queen of Australia. The power of the British parliament to legislate for our nation and our states has been abolished. The High Court has been affirmed as the pinnacle of our nation’s judicial system. We have created our own system of honours, adopted our own national anthem and appointed Australians to all our vice-regal posts as a matter of course. And throughout all that change and maturation, Elizabeth II has been a wise and encouraging guide, always wanting the best for our nation and its future, ready to allow Australia’s democratic journey to take us where it might. If Australia ever chooses a different constitutional path, it will not be for any deficiency on behalf of our monarch or her predecessors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the people of the UK and the Commonwealth want to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee, and they will certainly have that opportunity. Celebrations will be concentrated in the United Kingdom in the coming northern summer, and that is appropriate. There will also be a number of initiatives that will enable Australia to share in the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Last October, I joined British Prime Minster Cameron in announcing the establishment of Queen Elizabeth’s Diamond Jubilee Trust, which will support charitable organisations and projects across the Commonwealth. The trust will be chaired by a former British Prime Minister, Sir John Major, and will be funded by contributions from Commonwealth partners and private donors. I am proud to announce this week that Australia will contribute up to $5 million to the trust, which will provide a lasting legacy of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. I can also advise that Her Excellency the Governor-General will represent Australia at ceremonial events in London in June. One of the key events will be the lighting of a national beacon by Her Majesty on 4 June, part of a Commonwealth-wide event where beacons will be lit on a chain of hilltops all around the UK and the Commonwealth. That will include Australia, where I will light a beacon on top of Parliament House here in Canberra in support of this celebration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, Parkes Place, here in the Parliamentary Zone, in accordance with historical protocol, will be renamed Queen Elizabeth Terrace to complement the names of the adjacent streets, Queen Victoria, King Edward and King George terraces. Other commemorative activities will include: a jubilee stamp and coin issued by Australia Post and the Royal Australian Mint respectively; an essay competition for Australian students; and the creation of an annual scholarship or bursary which will focus on women’s leadership and related themes such as service and duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I can also advise that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales will be visiting Australia in the last quarter of the year as the Queen’s representative for the jubilee celebrations accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing valedictory in our Diamond Jubilee celebrations, nor should there be. As we saw here, in the Great Hall of Parliament House, on the streets of Australia and then at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth last October, the Queen retains a remarkable vigour and appetite for hard work. This is, however, a moment to dwell upon records broken and milestones reached, because the Queen is the longest lived monarch in British history, the second longest reigning monarch in British history and only the second to have enjoyed a diamond jubilee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But beyond the statistics of this reign lies consideration of its quality and character. Today we honour a woman who has conducted herself with utmost propriety and dignity, who has served her people with wisdom, fidelity and an unfailing sense of duty. Elizabeth II has made history and become part of history. Today we honour her indelible place in the story of our nation. And we express thanks for the sense of loyalty and service she has shown as our monarch but also as our friend. On behalf of this parliament and our people, I offer Her Majesty our sincere congratulations and best wishes for this Diamond Jubilee year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ABBOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I rise to enthusiastically echo the most gracious words of the Prime Minister on this important occasion and I join her in my own respectful tribute to our Queen on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee. This is truly a great milestone. Only once before in the 1,000-year history of our monarchy has a queen reigned for more than 60 years. Her first Australian Prime Minister was Sir Robert Menzies. Her first British Prime Minister was Sir Winston Churchill. She is a living link to that age of heroes, a sign of continuity and stability in our national life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has changed in 60 years. Much has stayed the same. We were a great country then and we are an even greater country now. Then, we were still part of an empire. Today, we are part of a dynamic but ever-changing Commonwealth. What has not changed is the Queen's unstinting devotion to those noble ideals of duty and service. What also has not changed is the respect and affection of Australians for the Queen, as demonstrated yet again during the latest royal tour, just last year. This is the paradox of the monarchy: the less actual power the Queen wields the more prestige she has; the fewer the decisions the monarch makes the deeper people's affection becomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much was said earlier today about Sir Zelman Cowen. It is important to remember his comments about the monarchy back in 1966, when he wrote movingly of its role in our system as something 'above and outside politics'. The Crown that was once the embodiment of executive government has become a symbol of all that is best in public service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the measures that have just been announced by the Prime Minister. I think they are a most fitting way of marking this important milestone. I particularly welcome the Prime Minister's announcement of a visit later this year to our country by Prince William, our future King. May I say, with feeling, something that perhaps is not said often enough in this most modern and contemporary of parliaments: may God save the Queen and may God bless this great country.</span>

It was a sad duty for me, accompanied by my partner, Tim, to attend Peter's funeral earlier this year along with other members of the parliament and, I believe, almost the entire parliamentary press gallery. He was a young man who fought incredibly hard against cancer—a young, young man taken from us and from his family far too soon. Even as he struggled with cancer and continued to come to work he turned his thoughts to fundraising for others. Many here would have participated in those fundraising events. One was participated in by Tim as a 'shave-off' event. Peter's courage was on display as he went about those good works, even as he battled cancer himself.</span>

I think her speech, along with the other contributions that day, will be in our minds and in our thoughts for a long period of time. Our thoughts continue to be with Bec and with his parents, David and Cheryl, in the depths of their grief, as we mourn a young man lost far too soon.</span>

The phrase 'respected journalist' is normally a bit of an oxymoron, but Peter Veness was not only a respected journalist; he was also a loved journalist. He was certainly very good at his job, as anyone who was grilled by him at the front doors of this building would know. But there was no edge to it and there was no malice to it, as the tributes that have poured in since his passing show.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly liked the tribute that came from the Director-General of ASIO, David Irvine, who noted Pete's meticulous attention to detail. I have often wondered about the clunk on the phone that sometimes happens, and it is good that ASIO are still listening in to the conversations that journalists have. Death is the ultimate mystery, but Peter Veness wrote about it with insight, pathos and humour. We miss him. We mourn him. We particularly grieve with his widow, Bec, and we acknowledge that, more than just about anyone else who has been in this place recently, he filled the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run.</span>

                  <a href="0V5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:53</span>):  Honourable members will not be surprised to learn that during the summer adjournment I was asked a number of questions about my intentions as Speaker. I have had discussions with the Leader of the House, the Manager of Opposition Business, Independent members and other members. I am very grateful for support for proposals I have made to reduce the time limits in question time, to extend the opportunities for members to ask supplementary questions and to rename the Main Committee as the Federation Chamber of the House of Representatives. I understand that some proposals may come before the House in the near future with respect to time limits for question time and the renaming of the Main Committee. In the meantime I want to let members know of my intentions in four matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I intend to adopt the same practice as Mr Speaker Jenkins in respect of divisions. Should an occupant of the chair wish to vacate the chair when a division is called, he or she should send a message to this effect to me. In these circumstances, I would propose to take the chair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I am required to exercise the casting vote, it is my intention to follow the principles set out in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hous</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e of Representatives Practice</span>—that is, that the <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">Speaker should always vote for further discussion;</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;"></span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Times-Roman;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;text-decoration:none line-through;">where no further discussion is possible, decisions should not be taken except by a majority; and</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Times-Roman;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;text-decoration:none line-through;"></span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Times-Roman;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;text-decoration:none line-through;">a casting vote on an amendment should leave the bill in its existing form.</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Naturally I wish to ensure that order is maintained in the chamber. In this regard, I seek the cooperation of all members. Without in any way being pessimistic, I confirm that it is not my intention to warn disorderly members before directing them to leave the chamber for one hour in accordance with standing order 94(a). While I would usually expect to warn a member prior to naming the member, this would not always be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I remind members that standing order 103 limits the scope of questions that may be put to the Speaker at the conclusion of question time to matters of administration for which the Speaker is responsible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to working with all members to do my best to ensure that the House fulfils what we all know are the reasonable expectations of the people of Australia. Copies of this statement are available on the table.</span>

The figures referred to in the Leader of the Opposition's question are another attempt by the opposition to mislead the Australian people. Treasury modelling shows—and the opposition is aware of this—that, under a carbon price, our economy will continue to grow. Jobs will grow, with employment to increase by 1.6 million jobs by 2020. Real wages will grow by 20 per cent by 2020 and 50 per cent by 2050. Incomes will grow. Gross national income per person will be $9,000 higher in today's dollars in 2020 with a carbon price in place. Vitally, carbon pollution will fall. By 2050, carbon pricing is expected to reduce Australia's domestic emissions by nearly half of what they would have been projected to be without a carbon price. The price impacts will be modest—a one-off increase of 0.7 per cent in CPI—and of course we also know that the carbon-pricing package comes with the benefit of tax cuts for working people earning less than $80,000 a year, many of them receiving a tax cut of $300.</span>

                  </a>  Then of course there will be Australians around the nation who no longer pay tax anymore as a result of us increasing the tax-free threshold. There will be increases in pensions and there will be increases in family payments. Behind this debate, Mr Speaker, is the essential question of whether or not you want our nation to stand still or be ready for the future. It is a fundamental choice. We have made it. We are getting our nation ready for the future and that future will require us to have a cleaner energy economy. In getting that cleaner energy economy, we are determined to do it at the lowest possible cost and the lowest possible price. The Leader of the Opposition stands for a policy which would impose a burden of $1,300 on working families—a policy that will not work. He stands for ripping tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases out of the hands of Australians who need that money. This is more of the reckless approach we have seen the opposition take to all of its economic settings. Whenever it faces a choice between getting ready for the future or standing still, it says: stand still. Whenever it faces a choice about running the economy in the interests of working Australians, it says: let's help the privileged few. Whenever it faces a choice about making sure our economy is clean and ready for the future it spreads fear and distortion, and today's question is just more of that.</span>

I also accept that the carbon pricing package of the government is the cheapest possible way of reducing our carbon pollution. When you want to talk about a drag on our economy, when you want to talk about a burden on working families, you would endorse the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. Let us have a look at the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, seeing he invites the comparison. If he wants to get it modelled, if he actually wants to tell Australians the truth about it, we will happily assist. What we know is that, because the Leader of the Opposition is in the business of subsidising polluters, he would make carbon pollution reductions at a far greater cost than carbon pricing; that is, he would do the most economically reckless thing—a thing that would certainly have a huge impact on economic growth and a huge impact on jobs.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, what I would say on comparisons of economic effects of carbon pricing packages is that we are determined to do it in the most efficient way. That is what the Treasury modelling shows. It shows economic growth. It shows income growth. It shows our economy growing. What the Leader of the Opposition is determined to do is do the most costly approach, wrecking economic growth with an impact for jobs and taking benefits off working families.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (Lalor—Prime Minister) (15:03):</span>  I thank the member for Oxley for his question. His region suffered flooding last year, and I have had the opportunity to attend with him and also with the member for Blair some commemorative events marking the suffering and loss that we saw last summer. Unfortunately, it is a sombre ritual that whenever this parliament comes back together at the start of a year we have something to reflect on that has harmed our nation in the time in between. Three years ago we came together and this House was devastated by the Victorian bushfires. We felt the pain of Victorians and the pain of Australians in those dramatic and destructive events. And then last year we paused to reflect on all that we had lost in the summer of natural disasters as it had hit so hard in Queensland and in other parts of the nation, including Victoria. Coming back to the parliament today, we actually meet at a time when, in Queensland and northern New South Wales, people are struggling with floodwaters and are seeing those floodwaters rising with all of the implications that that has for their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke last night to Senator Barnaby Joyce about circumstances in St George—a very beloved place for him. I have visited St George myself. I visited last time during the flooding. For many of the families there, this is the third time that they faced flooding. Last year, when I visited there, I met people who were worried about flooding then who had only just got their homes back together following the earlier flood, and now of course those same individuals are seeing floodwaters threaten. So we know that right around those parts of Queensland and into northern New South Wales there are people who are doing it very tough indeed, and our thoughts are with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In these circumstances, we have made available the resources of the ADF. They did such remarkable work last summer and some of those resources have been deployed again, including fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. I think people would be well aware of the work that both can do in times of natural disaster and some of the very dramatic, indeed, heroic things that helicopter crews did last summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been asked by Premier Bligh in respect of Queensland and Premier O'Farrell in respect of New South Wales to join with them under our natural disaster arrangements in making available category C assistance. That means that there will be assistance for small businesses and primary producers. The triggering of that category C assistance also means for those areas we have triggered the Australian government disaster relief payment, which is an emergency payment of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. These are being triggered in various shires in Queensland and New South Wales. So, for anyone who is interested in very specific information about their own circumstances, I would advise them to ring 1802266 to get help and advice. I am sure, as we sit this week, we will be thinking about our fellow Australians who are in those circumstances—some in evacuation centres, some very anxious indeed. Our thoughts will be with them.</span>

I express the thought that this will be of great interest, as well as to Senator Joyce, to the member for Maranoa and to the member for Parkes. When I spoke to the member for Maranoa last Friday, he was helping his community to prepare sandbags in Roma. When I spoke to the member for Parkes last Friday, he was readying his truck and his bobcat to help with the cleanup. It is good that the government is institutionally coming to help these people, as local members have been doing on the ground over the last two days.</span>

                  </a>  I would have thought that every member in this parliament would think problem gambling is a serious issue worthy of consideration and the bringing to that consideration of a serious demeanour given the number of Australians who actually suffer, sometimes with the cost of their lives through suicide, as a result of problem gambling. We will bring to this parliament the biggest package of change a national government has ever brought to problem gambling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the government worked with Mr Wilkie on mandatory precommitment. It became apparent that such legislation would not get through this chamber, in part because the opposition would not vote for it. It seems to me quite remarkable indeed that any member of the opposition who would have come in here and voted against such legislation now comes into the parliament to raise the issue of that legislation. The opposition was opposed to it. We will bring to this parliament changes that can secure parliamentary support because, when faced with a choice of doing nothing or getting something done that will matter to families around the nation, I am for getting something done. What we will get done will make a practical difference in the lives of Australians who struggle with problem gambling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, due to its relentless negativity, due to the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, that the demeanour of the opposition on any proposition for change is to say no. They do not want our nation ready for the future, they do not want working families to get a package of policies that benefit them, they do not want to support jobs, they do not want to build the new economy of the future and they certainly do not want to do anything to support Australians in need as a result of problem gambling. The test that will face the opposition, when we do bring this legislation to the parliament, will be where they will vote and what they will do, or will we see the same kind of hypocrisy on display then that we are seeing on display now?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms GILLARD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. The single biggest debate that we will have in this parliament over this 12 months will be about the economy. It is a debate that requires you to make some fundamental choices and a debate that requires you to define who you stand for, who you stand with and who you seek to benefit. We as a government have made our choices. We are determined to stand up for the interests of working people. We are determined to add to the package of policies we have already enacted to support working families. Those policies include the Paid Parental Leave scheme that the government brought into existence. They include putting more money into supporting families with the costs of child care than ever before. They include our focus on early childhood education and schools and making sure that people can get better healthcare services. They include the tax cuts that we have delivered so far. They include the changes that we have made in various payments, including through the pension, to support families at all stages of life, whether it be from the birth of a new child or from when mum or dad or grand mum or grandad requires the assistance of the pension. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we will add to that package of policies: new family payment arrangements for families with teenagers, tax cuts, pension increases, family payment increases and an expanded education tax rebate. Until this government enacted it, there was not assistance with the cost of getting kids to school. Now we will broaden that assistance. At the same time, we will be acting to build the new economy of the future. We delivered the foundation stones last year and it was not easy but it has been done. We will seize a clean energy future. We will get for working people a fair share of the resources boom that is underway in our nation. We will understand the changes happening in the global economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and as we see spectacular growth in our region and we will seize those opportunities for Australia's future. I want us to come out as a winner in this time of change in the global economy and in our region. We will deliver a new skills package and we will build on our education reforms because the economy of the future will require higher and higher and higher levels of skills. We will continue to roll out the National Broadband Network because yesterday's infrastructure is not good enough to build the new economy—and we will ensure that it is a diversified economy, one where mining is not the only source of strength, where we still have a manufacturing industry, where we still have people making cars in this country, where we still have a vibrant tourism industry and where we have a vibrant services sector. That is the debate of this year. It is about the employment of Australians. It is about their ability to get a job. It is about their ability to do that today and in the economy we will build for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of politics, we understand that in this debate they are for standing still. They are for the privileged interests of a few rather than for the many working families who need to benefit from our resources boom. They are for not moving to a clean energy future in any way that makes sense. They are for ripping the National Broadband Network out of the ground. They are for education cuts in schools, cuts to apprenticeships and beyond. This is the debate of 2012, and I am very happy to say to the Leader of the Opposition: bring it on.</span>

I would also make the observation to the member that sometimes the opposition wants to criticise the government because it says it has interfered in the Fair Work Australia investigation—obviously that allegation is untrue, but sometimes the opposition decides to criticise on that basis—and then today they walk into this parliament and say, 'Get right in there and interfere and hurry Fair Work Australia up.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot have it both ways. Independent is independent, and Fair Work Australia is independent. The real motivation behind this question I think is clear for all to see: the Liberal Party, the National Party and the current Leader of the Opposition have always hated the industrial umpire because they have always hated fairness for working people—and it is more of the same.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83L" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms GILLARD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. Can I say to the member for Melbourne that I do share his concerns about the circumstances of Australians who find dental care beyond their reach. I think all of us in this chamber know, just from practical, real-world experience, how expensive it can be to go to the dentist, and we know that there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who find themselves unable to meet the cost, with all of the pain and the degeneration of their teeth that that can cause for them. The medical evidence shows that, if you have chronic problems with your teeth, that can affect the rest of your body and your health care in general. So I do share the member's concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the Labor Party has had a longstanding concern in this area, of course we campaigned against the closure of the Commonwealth's dental program by the Howard government. We thought that was the wrong thing to do then. It is still wrong today to make those kinds of choices and the kinds of cutbacks which the Leader of the Opposition was famous for when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing. We have taken an approach of building capacity in dentistry both by providing new capital and by providing new investments in workforce. I remind the House that we have delivered practical improvements like subsidising around 1.5 million dental check-ups for teenagers. We have provided $125 million for eight dental projects from the Health and Hospitals Fund, delivering 220 new dental chairs. We have recently opened a $2.1 million 10-chair teaching dental clinic at the Adelaide Dental Hospital, which will mean an extra 52,500 hours of clinical training over the next five years for undergraduate dental and oral health students. We will invest $52.6 million over four years to support the dental workforce of the future, through a voluntary dental intern program. I believe that the member who asked the question understands the constraints in the provision of dentistry. They are not only the resources in the system but also the workforce, which is why these workforce investments are so important. I say to the member for Melbourne that I want to see us do more. But as we weigh what we can do in the budget process we will of course make the appropriate fiscal decisions for the nation. I understand that that has caused those opposite, who have got a $70 billion plan to cut the services government provides working families, to roll their eyes. They have never understood what it is like to do the hard work to get a budget to add up. They would take $70 billion out of the services that working families need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will keep working on proposals for dental care. In that regard, as the member for Melbourne knows, we have commissioned an expert body to provide us with advice and we have received a report from the National Advisory Council on Dental Health, which we established. We are waiting for them to present their final report. They have been working on that and we have received some advice from them, but obviously we want their final report to government. I conclude by saying to the member for Melbourne that we are certainly concerned about this problem. We have demonstrated that concern not only through our campaigning against the cuts of previous governments but through practical action during the life of this government, and we will continue to take that kind of approach.</span>

This side of the House stands for putting a price on carbon; those on that side of the House stand for putting their heads in the sand and ignoring their national and global responsibilities. We are about preparing Australia for the future; you are about burying Australia in the past. On the pricing of carbon, we should look to the multiple statements on his commitment to an emissions trading scheme or a tax made at various stages by the Leader of the Opposition. He has had so many positions that he makes the <span style="font-style:italic;">Kama Sutra </span>redundant.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I thank the member for his very important question. Today, the independent Reserve Bank left the official cash rate on hold. This follows cuts to the cash rate of 25 basis points in both November and December. In leaving the cash rate on hold today, the Reserve Bank has struck a balance between global uncertainty on the one hand and Australia's strong economic fundamentals on the other. We understand that families are doing it tough, but mortgage rates are significantly below the level that we inherited from those opposite. If you have a $300,000 mortgage at the moment and you are paying the standard variable rate, you are paying $3,000 a year less than you would have paid under the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important that we have continued sound economic management to deliver strong growth on the one hand and contained inflation on the other. The strength of the fundamentals was pointed to today by the Reserve Bank. They talked about the fact that China is still robust and the challenging conditions in Europe—although those conditions have got a little better. But they also pointed to the fact that domestic growth is strong and that we are expecting through this year trend growth of 3¼ per cent, trend growth which will support job creation in this country. We have seen 700,000 jobs created in Australia over the past four years. But a balance needs to be struck. As the Reserve Bank has said today, should demand conditions weaken materially, the inflation outlook would provide scope for easier monetary policy because the Reserve Bank is acutely aware of the challenges to our economy from the global situation. Thankfully, here we have unemployment at 5.2 per cent, half what we see today in Europe, and we are building on the strengths of our economy. Fundamental to that strength is our determination to deliver a surplus in 2012-13. We have seen the slapstick farce of those opposite today on the question of surplus. Yesterday the finance spokesperson was out there running away from a surplus at a hundred million miles an hour. The deputy leader joined him. Then of course we have the farce on television last night of the shadow Treasurer.</span>

We have the AAA credit rating—the sovereign, gold plated AAA credit rating—from the three major global credit rating agencies for the first time in our history, something which was not ever achieved by those on that side of House who every day of the week go around the place talking down our economy. We are determined to deliver tax reform to keep our economy strong. Those on that side of the House want to give a tax cut to Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer and they want to stop a tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses around our country. To keep our economy strong, we need good budget policy, we need tax reform and we need people who are serious about good economic policy. What we have on the other side is simply a rabble.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest the tragic accident on 8 January 2012 that claimed the life of an 11-year-old boy could have been avoided was a low point in television journalism and not supported by the facts. I table the joint press release issued by myself and Minister Duncan Gay on 20 January. The press release states:</span>

The matter is still before the courts, and they believe the long sequence of rulings and appeals has been an arduous process and clearly shows the new law needs fixing. In an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 7 January, the minister for workplace relations responded to the letter by—and this is being kind—fabricating, deliberately misleading and downright telling porkies—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr OAKESHOTT:</span>
                </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The matter has already been touched on by the minister at the table, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. In the lead story on the Channel 9 news on 19 January 2012, journalist Kevin Wilde reported that the death of an 11-year-old boy in a crash at Urunga, on the north coast of New South Wales—200 kilometres away from the electorate of Lyne—could have been prevented. He reported that because of political favours, federal money earmarked for the Pacific Highway at Urunga had been redirected to another project—that is, the Oxley Highway in the electorate of Lyne. The story included the use of terms such as 'death could have been avoided', 'pet projects' and 'cheap politics'. In this same story, watched by 1.7 million Australians, a state member was approached by Mr Wilde for comment and said these actions were the 'greatest act of political bastardry that I've seen in my time as local member'. The roads minister of New South Wales also commented in the story, claiming that he had 'damning evidence to support the claims'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On the back of this story, talkback radio in Sydney picked up on the same allegations. On Friday, 20 January, former New South Wales MP David Oldfield, who is now a talkback host on 2UE, opened an interview with the statement, 'It seems pretty apparent from all we know about this, doesn't it, that money that should have fixed this and saved this young man and other people's lives was directed politically to Oakeshott'. He also stated in the same commentary, 'Oakeshott does a deal, he gets money for works that are a lesser priority, and people die.' This is factually incorrect. The Oxley Highway at the heart of the allegation raised is a fully-funded state road—ironically, open today after 10 years of works in New South Wales and in the electorate. There is absolutely no federal money that has gone to the Oxley Highway upgrade and logically, therefore, there is absolutely no possibility of the diversion of funds for political favours even if we all wished it. This is an outrageous slur. It is inexcusable that it has been done on the back of the death of an 11-year-old boy on the highway and I would urge all involved politically to do nothing other than to fix the Pacific Highway.</span>

I regret to say that, having told us earlier today in question time that she wanted to bring on an economic debate, the Prime Minister then shut down question time and, of course, is conspicuously absent from this chamber for the beginning of the economic debate that this country needs to have and which this coalition will most assuredly win.

                  </a>  As my colleagues behind me remind me, this is the economic equivalent of the vacuous 'We are us' speech which she gave to the Australian Labor Party conference late last year and which I suspect might mark one of the milestones in this Prime Minister's downfall.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has two great responsibilities. One of them is national security, which is a responsibility for another day in this chamber. The other is economic security, and that is the subject which should be covered today. What the Australian people expect from their national government is the circumstances in which can be delivered good pay, low interest rates, strong economic growth and more jobs. That is signally what this government has failed to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is constantly congratulating itself because our economy is not as other economies are. That is no thanks whatsoever to the efforts of this government and all thanks to the reforms of previous governments including—let us give credit where credit is due—the reforms of the former Hawke-Keating government, which was in its own way and by its own light a principled government and a government of genuine economic reform. The comparatively, and it is only comparatively, strong position that Australia is in at this present time owes itself entirely to the reforms of previous governments and not at all to the spending spree of the current one. The Prime Minister has the gall to lecture European leaders on economic responsibility when the clear lessons of the eurozone are that a terrible judgment is ultimately pronounced against those countries and those governments which spend too much, borrow too much and tax too much. This government and this Prime Minister are copying failure. The only difference between many of the countries of Europe and this is that we are not as far down that fateful and ill-starred path.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government which has an evil genius for destroying value. This is a government which is proposing to spend $2 billion of taxpayers' money buying back perfectly good power stations in Victoria and closing them down. This is a government which is proposing to spend $11 billion of taxpayers' money buying back Telstra's copper wire network and closing it down. This is a government which is proposing to invest what will ultimately be more than $50 billion of borrowed money that we cannot at this point in time afford to build what is called a National Broadband Network which is one technology and one owner—the government—to deliver a service which Australians do not necessarily need, do not necessarily want and certainly do not want to pay more for. This is a government which excels in stultifying economic activity and at repressing the economic entrepreneurial instincts of the Australian people. The most extraordinary, the most remarkable, the most scandalous case is of course the live cattle trade of the Northern Territory. It was closed down by this government in a panicky overreaction to a television program. But there is more. There is the Tasmanian forestry industry, which is slowly being strangled by this government at the behest of the real deputy prime minister of this country, Senator Brown. There are the oceans which are increasingly being locked up by this government, again at the behest of the green movement. And then there is Senator Brown's proudest monument, the great deception perpetrated by this Prime Minister against the citizens of this country: the carbon tax. This is the worst possible time to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax, and it is just going to get worse and worse and worse as the years go on. The Treasury modelling, which is the Treasury modelling, clearly shows that by 2020 the real wages of the workers of Australia will be $600 a year, or about $12 a week, lower thanks to this carbon tax. Treasury modelling clearly shows that the GDP of this country will be a cumulative $32 billion less in 2020 than would be the case without the carbon tax. This carbon tax is a wrecking ball, smashing through our economy. This carbon tax is the great handbrake on what should be the mighty engine of economic growth, which government should be fostering, not restraining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It just gets worse. That is how bad it is at $29 a tonne. By the time the carbon tax gets up to $131 a tonne in 2050 there will be a cumulative $1,000 billion—$1 trillion—worth of lost production to our economy because of the carbon tax, and a $4,000 real decrease in the wages of the workers of this country. Do you call yourselves a Labor government, members opposite? What a scandal! What an embarrassment to any decent Labor voter that this government first tells untruths about a carbon tax and then introduces a carbon tax that over time will reduce the real wages of the decent, hardworking people of this country by upwards of $80 a week. Shame! The first impact of the carbon tax, economic modelling shows, is a 10 per cent hit on power prices that have already increased by more than 50 per cent since this government came to office. The next impact of a carbon tax: a nine per cent increase in gas prices, which have already increased by more than 30 per cent since this government came to office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a contrast with the record of the Howard government. John Howard would stand up in this parliament and say that the Howard government was the best friend that the workers of Australia ever had. On the record, he was exactly right, because what the Howard government delivered was a 20 per cent increase in real wages, two million-plus more jobs and an increase in the net wealth of every Australian of 100 per cent—a doubling of the net wealth of every Australian. By contrast, what have we seen since 2007 under the Rudd-Gillard governments? We have seen wealth destruction on a scale unparalleled in modern times. We have had stagnating productivity. The greatest embarrassment of all, which none of the braying interjections opposite can cover up: 2011 was the first year since Labor's recession of 1992 when there was no net increase in jobs in our economy—not a single new job in our economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did we have this? We had this because you could trust the Howard government with money. The Howard government was prudent and frugal with the dollars of taxpayers, which it knew and understood how to husband. The Howard government inherited a $10 billion budget black hole. It turned it into a $20 billion surplus. Over the life of the Howard government, for almost 12 years we had surpluses averaging 0.9 per cent—almost one per cent of gross domestic product. We inherited $96 billion worth of Commonwealth debt and we turned it into $70 billion worth of Commonwealth assets. Look at the contrast. Members opposite have turned a $20 billion surplus into the four biggest deficits in Australia's history. In 2008, Wayne Swan said, 'Peter Costello is just an amateur'—Peter Costello delivered a $20 billion surplus—'I am Wayne Swan, the "me Tarzan" of the Australian economy. I will deliver a $22 billion surplus.' What did our hero, Wayne the wonderful, deliver in that year?</span>

Every minute, every hour, every day, every week, every month let us debate the economy, because every time she mentions the economy we will say 'carbon tax', the economy-destroying carbon tax that this Prime Minister lied about before the election and now is inflicting on the decent, honest workers of Australia. This is a Prime Minister who has monumentally failed in many respects, but there is one respect, above all others, where she has most clearly failed—and that is in her judgment. Today's demand that all of the debate should be about the economy is yet another failure of judgment—like her failure of judgment in challenging Prime Minister Rudd, her failure of judgment in having an early election, her failure of judgment in announcing an East Timor detention centre without first talking to East Timor, her failure of judgment when confessing that there was no such thing as 'the real Julia' and her failure of judgment in doing a deal with Andrew Wilkie which she never intended to honour. This is a Prime Minister who has failed in judgment, who has failed in honesty and who has failed in commerce.

That is what the great thinker of the Liberal Party, the member for Mayo, has said—that all of these supports for families are 'the dead hand of government'.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms MACKLIN:</span>
                  </a>  and, as we have just seen from the Leader of the Opposition, they do not have one new idea for the future. All they want to do is say no and take this country backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I found it extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition said that the test for this debate was which government would deliver good pay and low interest rates—an extraordinary test. But he had no intention of addressing how he would deliver that in government and he refused to acknowledge that he was a minister in the government which delivered Work Choices. The Labor government abolished Work Choices so that families in this country could have the security that they need more than anything—the security of knowing not only that they have a job but that the good working conditions of that job are protected. It is this government which has delivered 700,000 additional jobs over the four years it has been in office. Just recently we were very pleased to see a very important pay rise delivered to some of the lowest paid workers in this country—150,000 community sector workers who, at long last, are getting a decent pay rise because of the changes that this government made to the Fair Work Act. This would never have been possible under those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition also talked about the importance of low interest rates. How important would it have been for him to tell the truth that, as a result of this government's good economic management, families are now paying less on their mortgages than they were when the Liberals were in government? Families know that under the Liberals they faced 10 interest rate rises in a row and that now, under the Labor government, families with mortgages are paying less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All that said, this government does understand that families continue to be under financial pressure. That is why, instead of filling this debate with abuse as the Leader of the Opposition has—filling it with the ways he intends to say no to everything that this government puts forward—I intend to take the House through all the positive things that this government is doing and has done for families. I will start with the most recent change—never delivered by the National Party or by the Liberal Party—to recognise the importance of family payments for parents who have teenagers over the age of 16. Under the Liberal government, when your child turned 16, family payments went down. It is this Labor government which has fixed that. Those families can now expect to see an increase of up to $4,200 in their budgets each year to help them meet the costs associated with having teenagers. All of us know that teenagers do not get cheaper as they get older—as, somehow, the Liberals seem to think. Of course, it was this Labor government that delivered Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme. Now we know what the Leader of the National Party actually thinks about paid parental leave. We know what he particularly thinks about the Leader of the Opposition's paid parental leave scheme. He totally opposes it. This government did not take any notice of their silly internal bickering. We got on with delivering a national paid parental leave scheme and now we have around 130,000 Australian families actually benefiting from 18 weeks of pay at the minimum wage, which is currently around $590 a week. And it will be this government that also delivers dad and partner pay so that dads and partners can make sure that they too spend some time at home with mum and baby after the baby's birth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also understand how important it is to make sure that parents get support when they go back to work and they need to meet the costs of child care. These changes were made by this Labor government, not by those opposite but by a Labor government that understands the costs of child care, a Labor government that understands that parents need help when they go back to work. We have increased the childcare rebate to 50 per cent. What that means is that half of parents' out-of-pocket costs, up to $7½ thousand per child, are now being paid—never done by those opposite; never delivered by them but delivered by this government. What we have also done is speed up the delivery of that help to parents as to the costs of child care so that parents are getting that childcare rebate more frequently to help with their fortnightly bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this government that has also introduced the education tax refund—never done by those opposite. These are real changes delivered by this Labor government because we understand that having a strong economy needs to be in the interests of families. That is why we are making all these changes. The education tax refund is delivering real payments, real money, to parents when they need it. As the children are going back to school right now, all parents understand that this is an expensive time. Australian families can get as much as $397 for every child at primary school and up to $794 for every child in high school. One of the important changes that this government has made is that it is also allowing families to claim for approved school uniforms as well as other education costs. All of these changes mean real increased support for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also recognised that it is not only families that need increased support. Our older Australians need it too, those Australians who have done a lifetime of work and want to make sure that as they go into old age they will be able to manage on the pension. It is this government that delivered the historic reforms—reforms never delivered by those opposite—that mean a single pensioner on the maximum rate is now $148 a fortnight better off than they were under the Liberal government. If you are a pensioner couple on the maximum rate you are $146 better off—never done by the Liberals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also delivering a much-needed boost to superannuation so that families can have security in retirement. It is this government that has delivered the tax cuts, and we know how critical it is to continue to do that. We want to see families have more money in their pockets. I will take you through what this actually means to individual families. Someone on $30,000 is paying $750 less in tax than they were when the Liberals were in government. Someone on $50,000 is paying $1,750 less in tax than they were under the Liberals. All of these changes have been made by this Labor government. When you look at what those opposite did you see they did not deliver to pensioners and they did not deliver these childcare changes. It was the Leader of the Opposition who said paid parental leave would be delivered over his dead body. These are all the things that are on the record as facts. It is not about hurling abuse, as the Leader of the Opposition is so wont to do. They are the facts, and we will continue to deliver to pensioners and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we meet the challenges of the future by making sure that we have a clean energy economy, this government will make sure that nine out of 10 households get help as to the modest price rises that will come about as the economy changes. We know how important it is to deliver the tax cuts, the increases in family payments and the increases in pensions. All of these things will be done to make sure that families and pensioners get the help that they need. We also know, and this became very clear in the Leader of the Opposition's statements last week, and families know—and they will be reminded regularly by all of us on this side—that you cannot rely on the Liberals. What was very clear from the Leader of the Opposition's remarks at the Press Club last week is that if they ever get into government they will rip out of the purses and wallets of pensioners and families all the money that this government intends to deliver starting in May and June this year. Given what we have also heard from the Leader of the Opposition, they cannot even decide whether or not—and this became very clear today—they are going to deliver a surplus. Are they going to deliver a surplus in their first term? Asked whether that would be the case, the shadow finance minister replied, 'It depends.' That is what the shadow finance minister has said. Obviously, as to whether or not he can find the $70 billion that they know they have got to find, he is saying: how would you know? We have seen today the member for Mayo, and I will go back to where I started my remarks, saying that all the things that families and pensioners depend on—the family payments, the childcare support, the disability support and the support for older Australians—are, according to Liberal Party philosophy, just the dead hand of government. So, is this where the Liberal Party will find the cuts necessary to fill their $70 billion black hole? Are they going to take it from the pockets of pensioners and families? We know that that is the Liberal Party's philosophy. They are the ones who say that that is where they will take the money from, because they have never delivered for pensioners and they have never delivered for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also made it clear that for those Australians who are some of the most vulnerable, the people who are looking forward to a Labor government delivering a national disability insurance scheme, all the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is put that on the never-never: never give any hope whatsoever to those people with a disability or their carers and families, who know how desperately in need they are. They know that they can rely on a Labor government to deliver a national disability insurance scheme. It was a Labor government that built Medicare—in fact, we had to do it twice, after a Liberal government destroyed it—and it will be a Labor government that has to deliver a national disability insurance scheme. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TRUSS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  At the beginning of the federal parliamentary year Australians are increasingly alarmed about the Gillard government and its lack of an agenda. The Prime Minister's authority is clearly in tatters. Her cabinet is split. The rank and file are bitterly divided, both philosophically and politically. If you throw in the Greens and a handful of Independents you have all the ingredients for a directionless, dysfunctional government that has no idea what it wants to do. It is completely out of ideas and it is bereft of an agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were so out of ideas that this past weekend they decided to bring the caucus together in a new-ideas forum to set a new agenda for Labor in the year ahead.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TRUSS:</span>
                  </a>  And, yes, as the honourable member said, 23 of them did not even bother to show up. They did not have any ideas at all. But I have a bit of an idea that there was not too much love at this love-in. They had the butchers paper out, and also the butchers knives. They were sharpening them up and there is no doubt at all it is the Prime Minister's leadership that was on the chopping block.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government without ideas. Indeed, after the event we seem to have heard no new ideas put forward. They had to bring back former Prime Minister Bob Hawke to give them some ideas—a blast from the past. They did not go to the popular former Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs; they went back a further generation to Bob Hawke to try to give them just a few ideas, but nothing came forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be thankful that at least the current Prime Minister only brought together her caucus for the barbecue at the Lodge. Her predecessor brought together a cast of hundreds and hundreds for his ideas summit. Labor was elected without any ideas and then they had to bring in people from all over the countryside. They came up with a thousand ideas, and four years later fewer than 10 are still breathing, let alone there being any kind of activity that might change the country. Labor is unable to develop ideas of its own and is now even unable to take ideas from others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister simply cannot be trusted or relied upon. Labor's national conference was just as bad. Labor forgot all about struggling families and the things that matter to them. Instead, Labor tore itself apart over gay marriage and uranium sales and so on. It is not just the issues themselves; it is also that they represent more broken promises from the Prime Minister and from Labor. Then, as the new year began, there was another broken promise. The written agreement with the honourable member for Denison in relation to poker machines has just been torn up. No wonder the Australian people do not trust this Prime Minister and this government. Then, today, the Prime Minister walked away from the commitment to the member for Melbourne and the Greens about dental reform. Another broken promise. Her word is simply worthless. She cannot be trusted. The Australian people are well and truly aware of that—the government cannot be trusted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer told us that last year was to be the year of jobs. The Treasurer said this in his budget speech and said it repeatedly at the Press Club and at other places. The theme for the year was going to be jobs, jobs, jobs. He said 500,000 new jobs would be created. Labor's primary emphasis in 2011 was creating jobs. And what was the final result? Nil. Labor created no new jobs. For the first time for almost two decades, no new jobs were created in Australia. Labor put all of its effort for the year into creating jobs, and they got none. Indeed, the situation is clearly getting worse. Already this year we have heard of Westpac retrenching 400 people; the Bank of Scotland, 200 jobs gone; the ANZ, 130 jobs gone, with another 700 yet to go; Holden, 100 jobs gone; Toyota, 350 jobs gone; BHP, 155 jobs gone; Reckitt Benckiser, 190 jobs gone; Manildra, 70 jobs gone; the Hydro Aluminium plant near Newcastle, 150 jobs gone; Tomago Aluminium, 100 jobs gone; Thales, 50 jobs gone; Don Smallgoods, 31 jobs gone; Heinz, 146 jobs gone; and, today, at Macquarie Bank, 1,000 jobs gone. This is the government that says it is about creating jobs, but that is a list of some of the job losses that have been announced for this year. Also, bear in mind that this is only a small glimpse at the jobs being lost. Almost every small business is laying someone off, but that is not in the newspapers. Almost every manufacturing business is laying people off. Labor's record in the manufacturing sector—the people they purport to represent and understand—is 130,000 jobs lost in manufacturing under the Labor government. Indeed, if we have a Labor government for too much longer, will we have any manufacturing industry left at all?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these just sound like numbers, but each one of these jobs lost is a job for a worker. It is a family without somebody who can meet the bills, a family that has lost a job because of this government's incompetence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we had the announcement of what Labor's theme is going to be for this year: they want an economic debate. This is the year for the economy. The Prime Minister called upon all of us to participate in a debate on the economy. Aren't we so pleased to do this. This is the government, after all, that took Australia from surpluses, from having funds in the bank, to massive deficits. The world's greatest Treasurer produced our country's four greatest deficits. He has no idea how to run the country. Labor inherited $70 billion in the bank. Now we have a net debt of $136 billion. The Treasurer is always running out there complaining about the banks not reducing interest rates as much as they should. I think the banks should reduce their interest rates more as well, but one of the reasons why the banks cannot reduce interest rates is that the cost of borrowing money is going up. One of the primary reasons why the cost of borrowing money is going up is that the government is out there borrowing more, $100 million every day. So when somebody is trying to get a home loan from their bank, they are actually competing with the government, which is there in the marketplace on the same day borrowing $100 million. If this government is serious about reducing interest rates, then it must borrow less. It must start balancing its budget. It must start being responsible and putting together an economic agenda that demonstrates this country can pay its way and can balance its own budget—set an example rather than criticise others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are leading up to a budget in May. That is going to be a really dodgy document because the government has already announced that billions of dollars worth of expenditure that was supposed to be in 2011 is being brought forward to this year. Other expenditure is being delayed until 2013-14. What they are trying to do is create one little year, one little window, when the budget might actually be balanced, but that is at the expense of a higher deficit this year and a higher deficit in subsequent years. They have diverted a whole stack of money for road funding into this financial year from the next financial year. There will not be any new roads sooner. It is just paying money across to the states so that they can shovel it out and it is not included in next year's budget. There is a similar story with the mental health program and a similar story with the carbon tax. Even though the carbon tax only starts in 2012, the big compensation payout to pensioners is going to be in this financial year. So they pay out billions of dollars worth of compensation this financial year and then collect the tax from the next financial year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a dodgy surplus, if ever it happens. In fact it will not happen. This government is not competent enough to put together any kind of logical budgeting. When they do put together a program, it is built around waste and mismanagement. Now everything is going to have to carry the extra burden of a carbon tax, adding to the cost of everything we do, adding to the cost of living, adding to the cost of manufacturing and making our economy uncompetitive. This is a government with no ideas. The ideas it has had have turned to lemons. They have been a dismal failure. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  Speaking of ideas, I recently read a biography of Michael Foot, who was the opposition leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Great Britain. He said, 'When making a speech, always surprise.' I was waiting for a surprise from those opposite—an idea, a policy or a purpose. I was waiting for some economic credibility, but all we got was economic negativity. I was waiting for the shadow Treasurer to speak and I was waiting for the shadow finance minister to speak. If they had any economic credibility they would be here, but they are off having an argument amongst themselves over the economic circus that we saw in the last 48 hours. When it comes to supporting Australian families, I think the record of those opposite is quite blank. The Leader of the Opposition talked about the golden age of Howardism, but one of the things he did not talk about is Work Choices. We saw a bit of that today with the member for Mayo. I think he has got a new philosophy. We will call it Briggsism. Pensions, family tax benefits and assistance to families are all the dead hand of government. I am waiting for those opposite to endorse Briggsism. We could have Hockeyism, where the member for North Sydney says he agrees with the last person he spoke to. If he says it loud enough, people might believe him. Or we could have Robbism from the member for Goldstein. He waxes lyrical and thinks aloud but he gets himself in trouble. We have got Robbism, Hockeyism and Briggsism amongst those opposite, but there is no economic credibility at all because those opposite have not got any ideas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard about roads from the potential Deputy Prime Minister, were he to sit over here. Roads! It is a bit rich. The Warrego Highway, the Ipswich Motorway and the Blacksoil interchange: those opposite voted against all of these road funding projects that are so important for South-East Queensland. They opposed the Redcliffe railway. For over 100 years we have been wanting a railway in South-East Queensland to Redcliffe, but those opposite opposed it. The member for Wright is over there. He knows how important the Warrego Highway is for his area, but he, like all those opposite, opposed the road funding in South-East Queensland. So we have economic credibility writ large on this side and completely absent on that side. All we hear is negativity and nay-saying. That is what they are on about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to what we have done, we have created more than 700,000 jobs. We have got rid of Work Choices so that people have fairness in the workplace. This is so important because those opposite occasionally slip it out when they use the word 'flexibility'. I want the families of Australia to know that flexibility means driving down wages. That is what it means. It means taking away people's pay and conditions. It means penalty rates, long service leave and other things going. Why do we say that? Because it was Labor that built the living wage. It was Labor that built the pension system and the aged care system in this country. It was Labor that built the universal healthcare system in this country. It was Labor that built Medicare—twice, as the minister said—and Labor brought in compulsory superannuation. Those opposite talked with jeremiads about this—alarmist rhetoric—when they were there. They said that this would bring about the ruination of Australian business and the ruination of Australian companies. We did it because we wanted to support Australian families. We did it during this government. We did things like the Paid Parental Leave Scheme. We brought it in. Those opposite never did. The Leader of the Opposition, famously or infamously, said he would never do it; it would be over his dead body. We brought in an education tax refund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, we increased the childcare rebate. We know how important this measure is for electorates. For example, in my electorate of Blair, in South-East Queensland, 7,250 families benefited from childcare payments totalling over $27.9 million in the year 2009-10. The architect of Briggsism, the member for Mayo, in his electorate had 4,800 families benefitting from the childcare payments, totalling almost $12 million in that same year. This is the bloke that describes this as 'a cycle of dependency' and 'the dead hand of government'. We are about supporting families. We are about supporting individuals. We want to keep the country strong. And we want to make sure, as we did during the global financial crisis, that we support jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition was literally asleep at the wheel when we were bringing in the economic stimulus package that saved 200,000 jobs. Last year, when we wanted to spread the wealth of the mining boom to benefit Australian families, he was sitting there dosing with the member for Leichhardt, who nudged him just in time to say no and to vote no. On bill after bill after bill after bill, he voted no. When it came to extending superannuation to help families and to make sure that a 30-year-old gets more than $100,000 more in compulsory superannuation when they retire, he said no. On regional infrastructure funding of $2 billion in my electorate in South-East Queensland as well as across Queensland, those opposite, including all those LNP members, should hang their heads in shame because they voted against it and also other projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should we be surprised? They have opposed infrastructure spending in my home state, election after election after election—including the Ipswich Motorway, the most important infrastructure project in South-East Queensland. For three elections in a row they have opposed the funding for it. We know that all the mayors and their councils in South-East Queensland support it, as they do all the infrastructure. They have been down here many, many times. Even Campbell Newman supported the Ipswich Motorway upgrade while those opposite opposed it for three elections in a row. I look forward to seeing what their attitude will be towards it at the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the Blacksoil interchange. The member for Wright sits opposite. He knows how important it is, because Steve Jones, the mayor of the Lockyer Valley, which is in his electorate, has told me how important that project is. We know how important that project is for the Lockyer Valley and the Brisbane Valley—the Somerset region. But those opposite opposed it. In South-East Queensland, 40,000 vehicles a day go through that intersection. Mums and dads are driving their kids to schools like WestMAC, to the grammar schools in Ipswich and up to Lowood high school and primary school. At Fernvale is the fastest growing primary school in my electorate. We know how important this intersection is for mums and dads. They and their families use that intersection at the Ipswich Motorway and the Warrego Highway each and every day to drive to work and to school as well as for reasons of recreation or business. The farmers need it as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families are crucial. We know how important families are in the life of this country. Children are a blessing and a heritage but they also cost money. We know that and that is why we brought in the education tax refund. That is why we increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We know how important it is to help families. That is why personal income taxes are lower under this government. That is why there is an historic increase in pensions. We increased pensions during the global financial crisis to make sure that people had the money they needed. We know that about 1.5 million Australians work in the retail sector. We wanted to make sure that their jobs were supported. That is why we gave out the stimulus money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that about 250,000 people work in construction across this country. That is why we did projects like the BER. And those opposite—and I have seen some of them—actually turn up to BER ceremonies, saying how great they are, because this is where school kids go for their education. Those opposite opposed the BER funding that was so important across length and breadth of this country. And not only that, but, during the flood crisis in Queensland, the BER halls acted as evacuation centres. Some of them were used before they were officially opened. We know how important they were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how important families are, and we have supported families. We have supported families historically. It has been Labor governments which have supported families. This Labor government supports families and it will continue to do so. I come back to what Michael Foot said: those opposite never surprise us because they are always on the side of the privileged rather than the many. They are always on the side of the few. There is no utilitarianism at all about them. They really will not help working families or the working class, because they always believe in their divine right to rule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to listen to the speeches of those opposite—the hard right-wing Thatcherism of those opposite. Michael Foot knew all about it, because he opposed it for years. If they come to this side of the chamber, we know that they will do it. We know that Work Choices will be back and that will impose pressure on working families. We support working families. We know how important they are for this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to keep this economy strong, and we have done so. We have low inflation, low unemployment and our economy is the envy of the world. When the Leader of the Opposition goes overseas he talks us up. When he comes back here he talks us down. He cannot tell the truth when it comes to the economic credibility of this country, because the Leader of the Opposition has no ideas, no notions, no policies, only aspirations—no commitment, only aspirations. We are going to deliver the NDIS. Those opposite have no aspiration. They should hang their heads in shame because they have no credibility with working families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I am always pleased to rise after I have been forced to listen to diatribe from members opposite about how the Labor Party has some kind of moral monopoly on the working class people of Australia. For some unknown reason—I should say for some reason only known to members of the Labor Party—it seems to be only people of the Labor Party in this chamber who are concerned with the lifestyles and the cost of living for Australia's working families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is a little secret for the Australian Labor Party: it is not about the rhetoric; it is not about the glossy language; it is not about the glossy brochures; it is not about whether or not Kevin Rudd<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s photo is big this week and Julia's photo is small or whether in fact it is Julia's photo that is big this week and Kevin's photo is small. What actually matters to those people out there who employ us to make a difference in their lives is what you deliver. It is results that count. It is the difference that you make in their lives that matters to them. What they know about the Australian Labor Party is that it is a complete and utter fraud. It is a fraud on any measure that you are prepared to use. On any measure that you are prepared to benchmark government performance on, the Australian Labor Party is a fraud because its rhetoric does not match the results. What we know is that the Australian Labor Party likes to talk about working families. Who could forget the election of the Rudd Labor government back in 2007? Granted, there are many who would like to on that side, but that notwithstanding who could forget it when we saw Kevin Rudd looking earnestly down the barrel of the TV cameras across the land saying, 'I am here for Australia's working families.' They believed him in large measure and that is why he was elected. What we know, though, is that promises that he would be 'just like John Howard but with a softer heart' and promises that he was an economic conservative meant nothing and they were followed through with nothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at Labor's performance in office, it has been abysmal. They have taken Australia from a $70 billion surplus position—from budget surpluses in virtually every single year of the Howard government—to now being $132 billion in debt. Labor members like to say, 'You are misguiding the Australian people because you do not take into account that we have had the GFC; you do not take into account that we have been so adversely affected.' The reality is that simply does not accord with the truth, because the Asian region has been through much greater economic tumult than the GFC. It was called the Asian financial crisis and affected our area of the world much more than the GFC ever did. Dr Emerson, an economist who is sitting at the table, has suddenly gone silent because he knows the truth, and he knows that Peter Costello's economic stewardship of the Australian economy ensured that, despite those economic headwinds, despite severe economic turbulence, the coalition was able to make strong effective decisions that led Australia to the lowest unemployment rate in 33 years, delivered a $70 billion surplus and ensured that we had productivity growth that left Labor's record for shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is more, we have heard Labor Party promises from mountain to seaside all over the country about how the Labor Party is concerned about Australian workers. Think back to 2007 and how Labor was going to make a difference to Australian families. There is one truly important measure on that, and that is what is happening to grocery prices, what is happening with people's budgets and the food they can put on their tables. We recall that at that time the Labor Party promised us this you-beaut initiative, this new policy pronouncement, called GroceryWatch. We all know that Labor walked away from GroceryWatch. It is very unfortunate that the minister responsible is the person sitting at the table there. I did a little Google search on the words 'GroceryWatch' and it was interesting to see that the first result that came up under 'GroceryWatch' was grocerywatch.com.au. It said: 'Hello world! Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post.' This was a $13 million initiative that the Australian Labor Party tipped down the drain and all you have got is a WordPress site that says, 'This is your first post.' The fourth result was much more interesting. The fourth result was an article that ran in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> by Kelly Burke on 27 June 2009. This was quite telling. It said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">…the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Craig Emerson, made the decision to scrap the grocery price monitoring website, just six days before its scheduled launch.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The article said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Government's $13 million election promise to force grocery prices down lies in tatters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought how apt because it is not just GroceryWatch you could apply that sentence to; there are so many from this Labor Party. You could say the federal government's election promise to introduce FuelWatch lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to install pink batts lies in tatters, the federal government's decision to remove pink batts lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to build school halls lies in tatters, the federal government's promise to deliver a surplus lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to keep interest rates down lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to introduce mandatory precommitment lies in tatters; and the most important of all election promises, the federal government's election promise not to introduce a carbon tax, lies in tatters. On every single measure, this is a government that has betrayed the working people of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is up under this government. Debt is up under this government. Let us look at some facts on the Holy Grail that the Labor Party likes to focus on—that is, interest rates. Although the Labor Party is very fond of claiming that interest rates are lower under it, we know in reality that interest rates are actually lower under the coalition. We also know that inflation is lower under the coalition. The reason these things happen is that the coalition controls spending. We do not go on $136 billion spending sprees. We actually make meaningful and considered decisions that deliver solid stewardship when it comes to the Australian economy and deliver results in productivity, inflation and interest rates.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Stephen Jones:</span>
                  </a>  The worst productivity in years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CIOBO:</span>
                  </a>  I hear members opposite talking about productivity now, saying we had the worst productivity. That is fascinating. Under the coalition government from 1996 to 2007, there was 1.2 per cent productivity growth and in the same corresponding period for Labor in government it was minus 0.9 per cent. Under the coalition government from 1996 to 2007, average annual labour productivity growth was 2.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent for the corresponding period that Labor was in office. So, once again, we see the facts simply unmask the truth about how this government is completely inept when it comes to economic stewardship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, my concern is that real Australian families out there who are trying to put food on the table, trying to service their mortgage and trying to meet all the expenses associated with raising kids in Australia today have been left worse off as a result of this government's policies. We know that inflation is increasing at what seems to many families to be an exponential rate. Electricity prices are up 51 per cent from 2007; gas prices are up 30 per cent; water and sewerage rates are up 46 per cent; health costs are up 20 per cent; education costs are up 24 per cent; and rents on average are up 20 per cent. And it is going to get worse. When Labor introduces the world's biggest carbon tax, midway through this year, we will see that. Expectations are that electricity prices will go up by a further 10 per cent in the first year alone and that there will be a nine per cent increase in gas bills. On Labor's own figures, families will have to fork out an extra $515 a year under the carbon tax—and that is before any of the hidden costs start to wash through the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that Labor is attacking other areas in the cost of living for the Australian population. Labor promised not to do anything to private health insurance. Now it is attacking that large proportion of the population that relies on the 30 per cent rebate to ensure that private medical cover is affordable for them and for their family. We have seen the price of child care escalate, up by an estimated $80 a week, as a direct consequence of Labor's policy decisions. On every measure, this is a government that is big on one thing and one thing only: it is big on talk. But when it comes to real action, real results and providing hope, reward and opportunity for Australia's working families, this government delivers nothing. It delivers higher unemployment. It delivers lower real wages. It delivers higher inflation and higher interest rates. It is Australian working families which have suffered as a direct consequence of this Labor Party being in government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs D'ATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  There seems to be a lot of reminiscing and talking about the good old days from the opposition today—and, by the sound of it, how keen they are to get back to those 'good old days' of the Howard government. We have heard a lot of bragging about the surplus of the Howard government, bragging about being friends of the working people and bragging about their fiscal policies. I would like to finish off what the member for Moncrieff started. Let us look at some comparisons between the Howard government and the current Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the unemployment rate, which was 6.4 per cent under the Howard government. Let us look at the participation rate, which was 63.5 per cent under the Howard government. Under the Labor government unemployment is 5.2 per cent and participation is 65.5 per cent. Let us look at taxes as a percentage of GDP. Under this government it is 22.3 per cent. Under the Howard government it was 24.1 per cent. That is what they are proud of—being the highest taxing government in Australian history. Let us look at this Labor government's real government spending. In the next five years it will be one per cent per annum, the lowest since the 1980s. During the Howard government's last five years it was 3.7 per cent per annum. Underlying inflation under this government is 2.3 per cent, whereas at the end of the Howard government's term it was 3.5 per cent. So, if we are going to talk statistics and facts, let us talk real facts. Let us stop the fear campaign that we know the opposition is so proud of and let us start talking about real facts. Let us start talking about the surplus of the Howard government and how they achieved that surplus by flogging off government assets. Selling Telstra—that is what it really was. That is what we need to talk about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us not talk just about the past; let us talk about now. Let us talk about what the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer would do to get back into surplus if they were in government. We heard it again last night from the shadow Treasurer: they would sack 12,000 public servants. That is where they would start. The MPI that the opposition put forward today is about helping Australian families and the day-to-day concerns of Australian families. Their solution to dealing with the day-to-day concerns of Australian families is: let us cut 12,000 jobs straightaway. That will fix the problem. If we look at the shadow Treasurer's idea of where those 12,000 jobs might come from, where did he target on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> last night? He said, 'Let's take 12,000 jobs out of health.' That will fix the system! That will look after Australian families!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the member for Moncrieff that Australia families want results. He said it is results that count; it is delivery. Let us look at some of the results that Australian families got under the Howard government. Let us look at what they did to Australian families. By putting in Work Choices, they did not just rip away penalties and take away job security; they attacked the most disadvantaged in the working community, the casual workers, who are predominantly non-English-speaking workers and women. That is how they looked after Australian families. In question time today we heard how the Leader of the Opposition looked after Australian families when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing: he took money out of health. But he did not just strip money out of health; he did away with the Commonwealth dental scheme. That is helping Australian families! Of course, let us not forget the absolute lack of investment in education and skills or in trades. Look at the burden that this country was left with at the end of the Howard era in relation to the skills shortage in this country, due to the lack of investment in infrastructure and job opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am happy to talk about the Howard years. I am happy to talk about the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition as a whole and what their future plans are. They oppose the NBN. They oppose supporting jobs through the financial crisis. They oppose any investment in schools, whether it be halls, libraries, computers or trade training centres. In anything to do with schools, they oppose any sort of reform. They oppose the minerals resource rent tax. Of course they do not want to give companies, predominantly small business, company tax cuts. They certainly do not want to increase superannuation to look after workers in their retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they do want to do one thing. What they do want to do is take money back from families and business and give it to those hardworking mining owners. Let us look after Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer because they are really struggling! They are the Australian families that the opposition really want to look after. Gina's family will be looked after. Clive Palmer's family will be looked after. But when we talk about the real day-to-day concerns of Australian families you certainly will not see those on the other side putting their hands in their pockets and saying, 'We need to support these people with jobs, with future opportunities, with health, with education.' It is this government that delivered on tax cuts. It is this government that will increase the tax-free threshold and provide further tax cuts for those earning up to $80,000. It is this Labor government that introduced the historic Paid Parental Leave scheme and it is this government that increased the childcare rebate. It is this government that filled the gap left by the Howard government in relation to family tax benefits and assistance for teenagers. It is this government that is investing in university places and trade training to give our kids opportunities and career paths after school. It is this government that is helping through the education tax refund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate alone there are over 10,000 families benefiting from the childcare benefits—over $25,000 in the 2009-2010 year. It is my electorate that is benefiting through the Moreton Bay Integrated Care Centre—our superclinic where for the first time we will be training GPs, as well as bringing dental training to the area and bringing specialists to the area. It is this Labor government making sure that the youth in the electorate of Petrie are being looked after with new youth facilities at North Lakes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this government who has finally stood up and invested in public urban rail across this country. It is only a Labor government that would do that. How much did the Howard government invest in urban rail? It is easy: zero. Absolutely nothing. Not one cent. It is this government that is delivering, in coordination with the Moreton Bay Regional Council and the Queensland state government, with Anna Bligh and her team, the building of the Redcliffe rail link. Those on the other side would never have done it and never did do it; it is this government that is delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this government that is not just providing the 35 schools in my electorate of Petrie, and schools all across the country, with important infrastructure but also introducing a national curriculum. The Howard government could not do it in 11 years. This government has done it. For the first time ever in Australia's history, whether you are learning at Mango Hill State School in the electorate of Petrie or at a school in Moreton, whether you are going to school in Tasmania, in Western Australia or in South Australia, you will be following the same curriculum. That is about giving opportunities, lifting skills in education and increasing productivity for the future of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liberal is about tearing down hopes and dreams; Labor is about building hopes and opportunities and is dedicated to long-term reform. We have seen what happens with Liberal governments in the states. Look at what is happening already in Victoria, in New South Wales and in Western Australia—attacking the most disadvantaged, attacking education, attacking health, attacking essential services and attacking police and nurses. We will see it in Queensland under Campbell Newman and his team if they get in: they will attack the most disadvantaged in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this Labor government that understands the day-to-day concerns of Australian families, and it is this Labor government that is facing up to the challenges for those Australian families now and into the future. It is this Labor government that makes the tough decisions to create a stronger economy and a fairer society for Australian families. The Liberal Party is about fear and negativity. It always will be. Whether it is Tony Abbott or any other Leader of the Opposition, we will continue to see negativity and we will continue to see fear. It can continue with that campaign because that is what it is about. Labor is about hope and opportunity. It is about caring for Australian families. It has done it since it got into government in 2007, it has done it throughout history and the Labor government will continue to look after Australian families into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I rise to enter this debate on the matter of public importance and talk about some of the families that those on the other side do not have the guts to talk about. They do not have the guts to talk about these families because they are doing them in the eye. They cannot look them in the eye because they are doing them in the eye. I will start with the families of the auto workers in this country. These are the 46,000 families around the country who rely on the automotive industry to sustain a living and to bring a wage home to look after their families and their kids. There are 46,000 workers—200,000 workers when you look at the downstream supply chain involved in the automotive industry—and those on the other side want to shut this industry down. They use weasel words, but we know what their real agenda is and the member for Mayo has belled the cat: they see this as useless government assistance to an industry that adds no value. We stand for these families in the auto industry because we believe in the value that they bring to the Australian economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another group of families that those on the other side will not talk to. That is the group of families who work in the steel industry. Those on the other side want to rip out $300 million from the Steel Transformation Plan because they do not believe in the steel industry in this country—$300 million that is going to keep open the doors of the two companies that are our two principal steel producers in this country. Those on the other side voted against the Steel Transformation Plan. Is it any wonder that those on the other side will not talk about the families of the steel workers in this country. But it does not stop there. There are the 12,000 public servants whose jobs they want to cut and send to the unemployment scrapheap<span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> They will not talk about those families and the families of those workers—12,000 Australians who they want to make unemployed to fill the $70 billion black hole in their budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you about another group of families—and this is an eternal shame—that they will not talk about. That is the families of disabled kids. To their eternal shame, their Liberal brothers and sisters in the New South Wales parliament cared so little about the families of disabled kids that they left the kids stranded at the bus stop. They did not even organise a bus to take these poor kids to school on the hottest day in New South Wales this summer. Is it no wonder that those on the other side will not talk about the families of disabled kids. They do not even have the ability to say, 'The National Disability Insurance Scheme is something that we believe in and we are going to put into place.' Those on this side of the House stand for the families of disabled kids—families struggling to give those kids some semblance of normality in their lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about the families who have opened their doors to poor disadvantaged kids to provide a foster service for them? They will not talk about those families either, because their brothers and sisters in New South Wales are doing exactly the same thing. It is the most heartless policy of slashing the payments made to those families in order to divert that money to some other Liberal boondoggle in the state of New South Wales. We on this side of the House in this parliament stand for those families. You will not hear it from those on the other side of the House, because there are so many families they cannot look in the eye because they are so busy doing them in the eye. While they are doing those families in the eye, we are busy creating decent jobs with decent wages, we are busy keeping interest rates low and unemployment low and we are busy ensuring that we are building the economy for the future so that these families have jobs for themselves and jobs for their kids. That is the stark contrast between those on this side of the House and those on that side of the House. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  by leave—This, the first sitting day of the parliament for this year, provides me with an opportunity to inform the House of recent developments in our neighbour Papua New Guinea. Australians were shocked to learn of the terrible loss of life that occurred on 2 February with the sinking of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rabaul Queen</span>. I offer to the government and to the people of Papua New Guinea our deepest sympathy as they deal with the trauma of this great national tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As might be expected of a close neighbour and friend, Australia has been heavily involved in support for the PNG-led response to this disaster. Australians can justifiably be proud of our rapid and effective response. Within minutes of the incident, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, passed on the distress signal to transiting ships, which responded quickly, and played a key role in coordinating search assets. Within a few hours, two AMSA rescue aircraft were deployed, one from Cairns and the other from Darwin. The aircraft from Cairns was able to drop life rafts into the sea to assist survivors while they waited to be rescued by merchant vessels. They were joined in the search on the first day by a Royal Australian Air Force P3 Orion aircraft. An Australian Border Command Dash 8 also contributed to the search and rescue operation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AMSA also engaged three helicopters and two civilian aircraft in the search, including a Queensland Careflight jet. These aircraft continued to search for several days after the sinking. AMSA also deployed several Australian rescue and recovery personnel to Lae to assist. The Australian High Commission in Port Moresby deployed a naval officer to the PNG Maritime Safety Authority. Another Defence member of the High Commission staff, based in Lae, coordinated with local agencies there and arranged refuelling of the search and rescue aircraft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not long after the first reports of this tragedy, I made clear to my counterpart, PNG Foreign Minister Ano Pala, that Australia will make all assistance available to PNG to deal with this disaster. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her statement of support for this position on the same day. We are proud of the joint PNG-Australia effort in rescuing 246 survivors. But none of this can take away the awful fact that many did not survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ferry tragedy came in addition to a large landslide in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea on Tuesday, 24 January. Australia immediately offered assistance to the PNG government following the landslide and has been in constant contact with authorities since the incident occurred. It appears from reports from the local community that at least 23 people are missing, presumed dead, from this incident. We mourn their passing, as we do those who have died tragic deaths in the ferry disaster, and we renew today our condolences to all their families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">PNG has been, and always will be, a key priority for Australian foreign policy. It has been a key focus of the Prime Minister, of mine, of the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and of the wider Australian government. Our engagement with PNG and its key government figures has been deep and close. I visited PNG from 30 September to 1 October 2011, the third visit that I have made to PNG over the last several years. I co-chaired with PNG Foreign Minister Pala the Australia-PNG Ministerial Forum on 12 October 2011 involving 19 ministers and parliamentary secretaries, including Parliamentary Secretary Marles, who visited PNG from 18 to 21 October on his fifth visit to that country. Of the many phone contacts I have had in recent months, I last spoke to my PNG counterpart, Minister Pala, on 2 February concerning the ferry disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister also spoke to her counterpart, Prime Minister O'Neill, on 5 February. Prime Minister O'Neill was welcomed to Australia for official visits in October and again, of course, for CHOGM. He had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Gillard at the Pacific Island Forum meeting on 8 September.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">PNG is a proud nation with strong economic prospects underpinned by their rich endowments in natural resources. Nonetheless, it is a country that has recently faced constitutional, political and legal challenges. Papua New Guinea is a sovereign country. In its almost 37 years of independence, it has established a record of vigorous democracy. It is for Papua New Guineans to resolve, therefore, their political differences. The ultimate resolution of political differences in a democracy is through the constitutional and electoral processes of that country. Australia respects PNG's sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As our closest neighbour, however, and with the historical and contemporary close links between our countries and our peoples, Australia has an abiding and strong interest in PNG's political stability and its economic development. Since the decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea on 12 December, the political situation in Papua New Guinea has been highly contested. Legal action is being taken by both sides of politics in support of their claims.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the first crisis in December, both the Prime Minister and I conveyed messages through diplomatic channels to the parties concerned on the fundamental importance of resolving constitutional, parliamentary and other political difficulties peacefully. At the same time, and again consistent with the advice of our high commissioner and as approved here in Canberra, both Australian Federal Police and Australian military personnel were actively engaged with their PNG counterparts in urging and in maintaining calm. The Papua New Guinea Defence Force remained in barracks. And, after some initial tensions, the internal divisions within the PNG police force were also resolved peacefully. Together with political communications through our high commissioner, these combined efforts contributed to the effective settlement of the situation in December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same approach was applied in the broad to the January crisis, which involved the temporary detention of the Commander of the PNG Defence Force. Once again, both the Prime Minister and I were in close contact with High Commissioner Kemish on the best response to the crisis. Both the high commissioner and the ADF once again engaged with PNG counterparts. Their efforts contributed to the progressive diffusion of the situation during the course of 26 and 27 January.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The engagement of our key officials in PNG was done in a calm, measured and respectful way, taking advantage of Australia's deep engagement with PNG across all arms of government. It was a dialogue of equals: Australian police spoke to Papua New Guinea police and soldiers spoke to soldiers. I would like to play particular tribute to our high commissioner in Port Moresby, High Commissioner Kemish, and the staff in the high commission for their effective work throughout this period. The calm and effective way they went about their business was a case study in quiet diplomacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to High Commissioner Kemish earlier today to get an update on developments in PNG over recent days. I reiterated to him the strong confidence that both the Prime Minister and I have in the high commission during what has been a sensitive and challenging time. I would emphasise that, throughout these incidents, both the Prime Minister and I have sought continued guidance on the most effective form of engagement with these incidents. The high commissioner's consistent advice, mindful of Australia's historical relationship with PNG as a former colonial power and mindful therefore of PNG's political sovereignty, has been for Australia to adopt a low-key public approach while working intensively behind the scenes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time, the high commissioner has cautioned against high-profile political visits to the country or high-profile political communications with PNG political leaders—for fear that such actions would fuel rather than ease the situation. It is impossible to rule out further political turbulence in the lead-up to PNG's general elections, due in the middle of this year. Our diplomatic, AusAID, defence and police personnel and other government officials in Port Moresby remain vigilant. And, in the spirit of constructive dialogue with their PNG counterparts, they are doing whatever is necessary to support continued stability in what all analysts agree is a difficult, complex and evolving political environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The messages that we are sending to our friends in Papua New Guinea as they deal with the challenging issues that they face are as follows: we respect your sovereignty; as your friend and partner, we take a close interest in developments and are there to help in whatever way we can; and it is important that the issues are resolved with restraint and in a way that gives assurance to the international community about the stability of your country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear that the government has for some time now been working closely with PNG to support election preparations. The forthcoming elections are very important. We are providing election assistance and are ready to do more. We have provided support to the PNG Electoral Commission—including in logistics, operations support, voter awareness and twinning between the PNG Electoral Commission and the Australian Electoral Commission—and we are responding positively to a PNG government request for additional operational and logistical support. Australian police are supporting the role of PNG police in election security with communications, training and additional recruitment. Defence is funding the commercial lease of two helicopters for the PNGDF to support the elections process as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As PNG works through its current political challenges, we continue to pursue our deep and broad bilateral relationship with the country. Our development program in PNG is our second largest globally—some $482 million in 2011-12—focusing on PNG's greatest development challenges in education, health, transport infrastructure, and law and justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two-way trade between our countries is now some $7 billion. Australia is providing technical assistance to support the establishment of a PNG sovereign wealth fund for its $15 billion liquefied gas project. Our police and defence forces have longstanding and productive partnerships. We have deep people-to-people links. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Kokoda campaign and the Battle of Milne Bay. Australia will continue to stand by our friends in Papua New Guinea in managing the many challenges that lie ahead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83P" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms JULIE BISHOP</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  Papua New Guinea is our closest neighbour and one of our dearest friends. Our deep friendship stretches back particularly to the dark days of World War II, when the people of both of our countries came together in pursuit of a shared and noble end. The bonds that were forged have carried our two countries forward, bridging any and all differences that may have stood momentarily in our way. The coalition is deeply committed to building on the close ties that exist between Australia and Papua New Guinea as two nations with a shared interest in upholding peace and prosperity in the Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the enduring friendship that exists between our two countries that has made the past few months in Papua New Guinea so difficult and, in the case of recent tragedies, that much more distressing to watch. The coalition was deeply saddened to hear the news of the latest tragedy to strike the people of Papua New Guinea. The sinking of the <span style="font-style:italic;">MV Rabaul Queen</span> in waters off Lae shocked not only a nation but all those who have spent time in Papua New Guinea and enjoyed the warm hospitality of its people. As of yesterday, 246 people had been rescued. Sadly, five people on board the ferry did not share their good fortune. Little hope is left for those still unaccounted for. The coalition offers its heartfelt sympathies to those who lost loved ones in the incident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Papua New Guinea can be assured that the thoughts and prayers of all Australians are with them at this difficult time. We wholeheartedly support the Australian government in its efforts to assist the government and people of PNG in the days and weeks that follow. I particularly pay tribute to the work of our High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea and his staff, who have coordinated our efforts. That this tragedy followed so soon after a disaster in the Southern Highlands, where a landslide destroyed a small village community as it slept, makes it even more distressing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These incidents have come at a time of heightened political instability in the country. The decision of the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court on 12 December last year, that the removal of Sir Michael Somare from office in August was unlawful, continues to cause confusion and instability in a country that is in desperate need of stability. So complicated had the situation become that at one point the country had two governors-general, two prime ministers and two police chiefs. At that time Papua New Guinea<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s defence force was to be commended for remaining outside of the political street fight that was taking place all around it. However, this situation took a confronting turn on 26 January 2012 when 20 soldiers, led by Colonel Sasa, entered Murray Barracks in Port Moresby, taking the head of the military hostage in a desperate attempt to reinstate Sir Michael Somare as Prime Minister. Claiming that he had been duly appointed as commander by Sir Michael, Colonel Sasa ordered the Prime Minister, Peter O'Neill, to step down from office or he would 'take all necessary actions to protect and uphold the integrity of the constitution'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this stand-off has largely been resolved, the broader issue of PNG<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s government remains hotly contested, with little prospect at the moment for compromise. The political situation must be resolved within their parliament, within their courts if necessary and ultimately at the ballot box. As Papua New Guinea<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s national election approaches, it is essential that political stability is restored as soon as possible so that free and fair elections can take place reflecting the will of the people of Papua New Guinea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In all the confusion that has taken place, one policy before the Papua New Guinea parliament worthy of greater attention is a bill that will set aside 22 seats for female representatives. I congratulate the supporters of the bill, who have worked so tirelessly to get it before the parliament. I had the honour of meeting Dame Carol Kidu, the inspiration and driving force behind the bill, when I was in Port Moresby last year. Dame Carol is the Queensland-born wife of the late PNG Chief Justice, Sir Buri Kidu. As the only female representative in the PNG parliament, she faces challenges that women members of parliament in Australia can barely comprehend. Australia looks to the Papua New Guinea parliament in the hope that it can unite around this common good and deliver the change that is needed for this worthwhile bill to take effect. The women of Papua New Guinea have an enormous contribution to make to the peace, order and good government of PNG, and I look forward to their enhanced participation in PNG political life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this comes at a unique stage in Papua New Guinea<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s national history. The development of its oil and gas industry looks set to transform its economy, with the PNG LNG project alone expected to double the country's gross domestic product and triple its exports. According to an economic impact study by ACIL Tasman:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The project has the potential to transform the economy of Papua New Guinea, boosting GDP and export earnings, providing a major increase in government revenue, royalty payments to landowners, creating employment opportunities during construction and operation, and providing a catalyst to further gas-based industry development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The project will hopefully help transform PNG and, as a consequence, I hope that the Australia and PNG relationship can move from that of donor-recipient to robust economic partners. It is an ambition that is shared by the government and the people of PNG.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges that come with a booming resource sector are well known. In a country like Papua New Guinea, where the governance institutions are still developing, it can present significant problems as well as benefits. With revenues flooding in through foreign investment, there is also the concern that political will for further reform in other areas may falter. As Aaron Batten has written for the <span style="font-style:italic;">East Asia Forum</span>, 'Those provinces which have recorded the largest earnings from resource extraction have been plagued by the weakest governance, the poorest levels of service delivery and in many cases violence.' It is therefore more important than ever that Australia broaden, deepen and diversify its relationship with PNG. For this to occur, however, greater leadership on Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s part is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the coming months and years ahead Australia will be judged for what it does, not what it says. I am of the view that PNG must be one of our highest foreign policy priorities, and I can state unequivocally that a coalition government will ensure that our relationship with Papua New Guinea is one of our country's highest foreign policy priorities. The coalition believes that Australia must stand alongside the PNG government and its people consistently and unequivocally in their efforts to fulfil the country's immense potential and lay claim to its rightful status as a natural leader in the Pacific Ocean region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has been critical of the Australian government for neglecting our near neighbours as it pursues its grand adventure for votes for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council. I have repeatedly called on the foreign minister to focus his efforts on our neighbourhood. While there are many pressing issues in the world, as we are seeing on a daily basis in the Middle East, it is within our immediate region that Australia has the greatest influence and can do the most good. As former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer wrote recently, the recent political events in PNG should serve as a wake-up call to Australia. Australia must work to develop a level of intimacy and goodwill in our bilateral relationship that can serve us during times such as these. As the current political crisis has shown us, it is essential that Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s political leaders, particularly Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s foreign minister, maintain the closest working relations with our colleagues in Port Moresby. This can only be achieved through close and consistent contact at the highest level.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RUDD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  On behalf of the Australian government, I condemn the appalling and escalating violence in Syria. In the last few days alone the world has witnessed the barbaric massacre of civilians in Homs, with over 200 people killed within 24 hours. This violence has shocked the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For over a year now, we have seen violence and human rights abuses taking place across Syria. Well over 5,000 people have died—so many more in fact that the United Nations has had to stop counting as numbers are now hard to verify. The UN Human Rights Council has pointed to substantial evidence of gross human rights abuses by Syrian security forces. The regime is targeting innocent civilians, including by directing heavy weaponry, tanks and snipers against civilians and in major population centres such as Homs, Idlib, Hama and Deraa. These abuses are getting worse, as Syrian people are being subjected to unjust detention, sexual violence and torture. This is intolerable and is unacceptable to the international community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is profoundly disappointed at the veto of the United Nations Security Council's proposed resolution on Syria last weekend. What we saw in New York was a failure of key members of the international community to live up to their responsibilities to help, support and protect the Syrian people. This failure was an abdication of responsibility. There was no good reason to explain why this resolution was not passed. It was backed by 13 members of the council. It did not call for military action; it did not call for regime change; it did not call for an arms embargo; it did not even impose sanctions. It was a watered down draft which had been discussed and debated and wrangled over and repeatedly weakened to attract the maximum support in the council. What the resolution did do—crucially—was to call for support for the Arab League's own initiative to bring about a peaceful, Syrian-led political resolution to this crisis. Despite all the compromises on the text, China and Russia still rejected this regional peace initiative. The Arab solution was not supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">China and Russia now must explain to the people of Syria and to the international community their alternative plans for ending the violence in that country. Under the emerging doctrine of international humanitarian law, the international community has a responsibility to act to protect the people of Syria from this appalling violence from their own regime. Just as the people of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and many other regional countries have now found new freedoms from more representative, democratic political life, so the Syrian people deserve the same opportunity. Freedom is a universal human aspiration. Under both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the subsequent International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all members of the human family have basic human rights that must be protected: freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; freedom of expression; the right to self-determination; and the inherent right to life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Assad has lost all legitimacy and has shown a complete disregard for the rights and welfare of the Syrian people. Assad should step down and he should step down now. The violence by the Assad regime must end and it must end now. The Australian government has condemned the intolerable, intensifying human rights abuses in Syria from the beginning. For over half a year now we have urged the international community to act. We ourselves have taken our own steps:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">We have imposed sanctions against the regime targeting 34 individuals and 13 entities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">We have imposed an arms embargo against the supply, sale or transfer to Syria of arms and related materiel.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">Back in June last year, we were among the first states to provide dedicated funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross (at its specific request) to support the Syrian Red Crescent in providing support to people affected by the conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">We have co-sponsored resolutions on Syria in the UN Human Rights Council on four occasions.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">I have met with the Syrian National Council in Paris—the principal opposition group to the Assad regime—only a week or so ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key question we now face is: where to from here? What options does the international community have given the UN Security Council has failed to respond to this crisis? There are two key points to be made here. Firstly, the Assad regime is doomed. Assad is isolated and has nowhere to go. The demise of the regime is only a matter of time and, tragically, of how many people will die in the process. Secondly, the UN Security Council's failure does not mean an end to international efforts to help the Syrian people. The Arab League has stood by the Syrian people and has shown great commitment and global leadership on this crisis. The Arab League and the people of Syria should know that they are not alone. Australia is united with our Arab, European and American partners in our commitment to do what we can to help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian support for the efforts of the Arab League is unwavering. I therefore welcome calls by both our United States and EU partners to work with Arab partners to establish an international support group of like-minded countries to work in concert to support peaceful transition in Syria and the earliest end to the bloodshed. This would be a key mechanism for coordinating international assistance to the people of Syria, backing the diplomatic efforts of the Arab League, maintaining pressure on the Assad regime and of course ensuring this crisis remains on the agenda of the UN Security Council, despite the council's repeated failings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last night I spoke to the UK Foreign Secretary, William Hague, on plans to work with the Arab League to set up such a body. Australia's ambassador to Qatar spoke this morning to the Qatari government, currently the chair of the Arab League, to underline Australian commitment to this initiative and to discuss how to build further international momentum for its formation. Over coming days I plan to speak to more of my counterparts, particularly those in the Arab world, to flesh out plans for this group and again to underline Australia's support as a responsible member of the international community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's commitment to the people of Syria remains resolute. Despite the failure of the UNSC to take action, the Australian government is committed to its own autonomous measures to pressure the Assad regime. Today I announce that we are taking further measures to underline this commitment. In addition to the sanctions we have already imposed on Syria, Australia will impose further autonomous financial sanctions and travel bans on 75 Syrian individuals and 27 entities not already listed by Australia. These measures are designed to hold those who have engaged in human rights abuses, including the use of violence against civilians, accountable for their actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government will continue to work with our partners in the international community to see what further measures can be taken to underline to Assad that he and his regime have no future. Meanwhile, we continue to consider what steps we can take to directly assist those suffering in the conflict now. We in Australia, as always, will play our part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has provided $3 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to help alleviate the humanitarian situation currently faced by the Syrian people. Today, I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide a further $3 million to assist the work of the ICRC in Syria. This will help the ICRC's work with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to support those affected by the ongoing crisis by providing medical facilities and assistance. This funding provides nearly one-quarter of ICRC's current emergency appeal for $13.1 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government believes that the international community still has an important role to play in this crisis. Syria must remain on the agenda of the UN Security Council and we will continue to encourage this. Australia also looks forward to working with like-minded states on a possible resolution on Syria for consideration by the UN General Assembly. Such a resolution would be a critical demonstration of the international community's condemnation of the massacres that we have seen unfold in Syria in recent times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government firmly believes that those committing acts of violence, human rights abuses and war crimes must be held accountable for their actions and that the Syrian people, like the other peoples of the Arab world, should enjoy the political freedoms which we in Australia take so readily for granted.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83P" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms JULIE BISHOP</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  The violence in Syria must stop. The ongoing slaughter of innocent, largely unarmed, people is a hideous affront to people the world over. President Assad can put a halt to this bloodshed now by ordering his security forces and the Syrian military to stop shooting civilians. President Assad can make this decision without a resolution of the United Nations Security Council. He can show a shred of humanity that has not been seen to date and he must immediately put an end to this indiscriminate violence. There can be no justification for the ongoing crackdown against peaceful demonstrators. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said, the Assad regime lost all legitimacy to govern Syria when it turned guns on its own people. President Assad should step aside and allow for the formation of an elected civilian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Events in Syria are enormously important, as the conflict is a microcosm of religious and cultural rivalries and tensions that exist across the Middle East and beyond. The regime is dominated by those who follow Alawi Islam, which is related to Shiite Islam. Alawites make up about 12 per cent of Syria's almost 21 million citizens. About 75 per cent are followers of the Sunni Islam faith. The remainder of the population are Christians, Druze and a smattering of other religions. While the minority Alawites believe they were oppressed by the Sunni majority for many years, that cannot be used to justify the behaviour of the current regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an oversimplification of the situation in Syria to characterise this as a conflict driven solely by sectarian divides; however, this is a critical factor in the situation within Syria and in the actions of other nations. The Sunni dominated government of Turkey has come out strongly in support of the Syrian opposition while the Shiah dominated government of Iran has continued to provide support to the Assad regime. Similarly, there has been strong condemnation of the Syrian regime from many of the Gulf Sunni monarchies, which regard Iran as a strategic rival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arab League has been criticised in the past for not taking a strong stand against atrocities within its sphere of influence. While not free from controversy, the Arab League has been more active with regard to Syria. An observer mission was launched late last year and continued until late last month when Gulf Arab observers were withdrawn in protest at the ongoing violence. Other observers remain in Syria. The Arab League turned to the United Nations for support and drafted a motion for Security Council consideration. That the Arab League nations took this step is to be encouraged and commended. That motion, however, was vetoed by Russia and China. The double veto of the UN Security Council resolution on Syria is particularly disturbing and concerning given that the resolution had the support of all other Security Council members, including temporary members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arab League Secretary General said in a statement released last Sunday that the veto of the resolution 'does not negate that there is clear international support for the resolutions of the Arab League'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Arab League will continue efforts with the Syrian government and opposition, and coordinating with all sides related to the Syrian issue, in order to realise the higher objectives which the Arab League is working towards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, the double veto of Russia and China must give a level of comfort to the Assad regime, which will now feel less pressure to stop the murderous crackdown on Syrian protesters. The actions of Russia, in particular, are deeply concerning, as it continues to supply arms to Syria. What is also disturbing is that neither Russia nor China have put forward a plausible alternative plan, and so the bloodshed continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Individual nations can of course take action beyond that of the Security Council and can apply economic and other sanctions. The Australian government has imposed a range of sanctions, including a ban on arms sales, financial sanctions and travel sanctions. I acknowledge the foreign minister's announcement of further sanctions today. The coalition supports these actions and I urge the foreign minister to continue to monitor developments and to consider increasing or adapting sanctions as necessary. I also support the foreign minister's announcement of further assistance to the International Committee of the Red Cross working with the Red Crescent in Syria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the international community presents a united face to the regime in condemnation of its actions. A successful United Nations Security Council resolution would have indicated the level of resolve within the international community to end the bloodshed and the violence. There have been calls for military intervention, but that should be a last resort and there are other avenues to be pursued at this stage. I certainly believe that more effort can be made. There is more work to be done with Russia and China and most certainly more to be done within the international community in relation to economic sanctions. United States President Obama has said in recent days that the situation in Syria can be resolved through non-military means and that remains the focus of the United States. The key is for international pressure to be unrelenting on the regime until the violence stops.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of concern are the reported comments of a former senior military officer from the Syrian army. General Mustafa Ahmed al-Sheikh is reported to have claimed in recent days that the Syrian army and the regime are close to collapse. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The situation is now very dangerous and threatens to explode across the whole region, like a nuclear reaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the Arab League has warned in recent days that the regime's use of heavy weapons such as artillery was a serious escalation that could see the country slide into a protracted civil war. Other analysts, including Jackson Diehl from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span>, have argued that the conflict will drag on for years if support for the current regime continues from Iran and Russia in particular. The great fear is that a civil war in Syria will destabilise the other countries in the region, including neighbouring Lebanon and Jordan, for example, as well as Iraq. The worst possible outcome would be for sectarian lines of conflict to open up in other nations of the Middle East. Tensions in the small kingdom of Bahrain have been simmering since the majority Shiah rallies were crushed by the security apparatus of the Sunni minority rulers. Large numbers of Shiah live in some of the most productive oil fields of Saudi Arabia, and international concern has been expressed about the potential for conflict in the region that could disrupt global oil supplies and deliver a severe blow to the global economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stakes are very high, indeed. That is why Russia and China should act in support of the efforts of the international community to end the cycle of violence and to allow the Syrian people to peacefully express their desire for greater freedoms and a better way of life than can possibly be realised under the murderous fist of Assad and his cronies.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MIRABELLA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 is largely an uncontentious bill. I am therefore happy, on behalf of the opposition, to state that we will be supporting it. Providing continued support to the Australian Research Council is of course an inherently good thing, and both sides of politics have long recognised the organisation's importance in contributing to and sustaining Australian research of the highest quality. Indeed, in introducing this bill the government is honouring the longstanding practice of annually amending the ARC Act to apply indexation to existing appropriation amounts and to create an additional forward estimate. The principle was first adopted by the Howard government in 2001 and has been continued on an annual basis ever since.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, I am not entirely sure of the reason for the substantial drop in funding for 2014-15 and would therefore welcome some clarification from someone in the government about the precise reasoning behind that. This is a government that has already cut the budget for the highly regarded Cooperative Research Centres program by tens of millions of dollars. It also attracted flak from the CSIRO association for what were described as modest changes to the CSIRO's quadrennial funding that would lead to job losses without growth in external revenue. So I would be keen for an explanation of how this drop in the ARC's funding aligns with all of that as well. Perhaps someone can explain whether it is just an oversight, because it does not really tally with what the newly installed Minister for Industry and Innovation has been implying in media interviews—how the government's whole strategy for industry apparently hinges on spending more on innovation and research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would also be nice to hear the government address a problem to which I am alerted over and over again by businesspeople. There is ever-rising discontent in many parts of Australian industry about what is often perceived as a widening gulf between the amount of research produced in Australia and the level of tangible practical benefits of that research for Australian businesses—in other words, the commercialisation of that research. This is a critical problem that I know staff at the ARC well understand, but I am worried that some members of the government are suffering from the misapprehension that it is not a particularly serious issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some other words in the minister's second reading speech that are probably worthy of note, at least in passing. What was particularly noticeable were his references to 'the big issues of our time', including 'our need to transform our manufacturing industries to create greener, healthier and more resilient processes'. It is a terribly sad day when almost all government ministers, when it comes to innovation, industry, science and research, have only these banal turns of phrases. All they can say about policy are lines like 'innovate or perish' or 'innovation policy is industry policy'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of businesses becoming more environmentally efficient was self-evident years and years ago. That is why so many of them have made the transition and invested significantly in becoming greener and more efficient. These are not new discoveries or revelations. It is disappointing that the Labor Party continues with such a dismissive attitude towards Australian businesspeople, simply in the name of trying to justify the unjustifiable and to pretend that policies like the introduction of an economy-destroying, job-destroying, competition-reducing carbon tax are a good idea. Manufacturing policy—and the future of it in Australia—should be about so much more than abysmally poor policy and patronising one-liners from ministers and their colleagues on the government benches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was at least one other curious part of the minister's speech. I initially thought I must have heard him incorrectly. But then I checked the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and, believe it or not, he did actually say that the ERA is 'a key element of the government's 10-year innovation agenda, Powering Ideas'. Let us not kid ourselves. The government recently made a humiliating backdown on the ERA after digging its heels in for years against sound and widespread advice. There was a complete 180-degree backflip from Senator Carr on this. As for Powering Ideas, even the hand-picked expert author of the review that led to that document has since savaged the government's complete lack of taste and heart for serious reform in the area of innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude by restating that I am pleased to support the government's introduction of this bill but would hope that the government uses the occasion of the bill's passing to reflect on the fundamental importance of valuing and targeting research spending as wisely as possible, and of course being more serious about forging better linkages between researchers and industry. The coalition strongly supports Australian innovation and research and recognises its inextricable linkages with increased productivity and increased living standards. It will be a cornerstone of our future economic growth. In the face of mounting debt and deficit and with many parts of Australian industry struggling, there has rarely been a more important time for us to be extracting the maximum possible benefits from our national research investments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. In a moment I am going to respond to some of the comments just made by the member for Indi. Before I do, I will get to the purpose of this bill. The purpose of the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 by adjusting the existing funding caps and inserting a new funding cap for the 2014 financial year. This bill provides additional funding to the Australian Research Council as part of the standard budget process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important legislation to ensure that the Australian Research Council can continue to support high-quality research throughout Australia. Of course, it is important that we ensure that this money is well spent. The Australian Research Council not only supports quality research and research careers but also helps the government measure its research investment and assure taxpayers that their money is being invested wisely. The future of our country, our prosperity, our quality of life, our place in the world, our very existence is very much dependent on the quality of education of our people, on the research commitments we make and on the knowledge and innovation arising from that research. Australia has some of the finest research institutions in the world, such as the CSIRO. In my own region, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is an outstanding example of a research facility. We have wonderful medical research facilities right around the country and we have many people in the private sector simultaneously and equally carrying out very important research. In addition and very importantly we have universities around the country carrying out research every day on different matters affecting the lives of people not only in Australia but also right around the world. It is a strength and an asset which we should not overlook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian research has brought not just important innovation to us all but national pride. Now more than ever we live in a highly competitive world and innovation will become even more critical in giving Australia a competitive advantage. A very clear and real example is the competition faced by Australia's automotive sector. It is with respect to that sector that I want to respond to the comments made by the member for Indi, who talked about manufacturing in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturing is incredibly important to the livelihoods of so many people in so many communities wherever you go because, quite frankly, it underpins the livelihoods of many other sectors. I am acutely aware of that because in my own region manufacturing is still the largest employer, underpinning many other industries and the advanced manufacturing arising from them. Advanced manufacturing relies on research. In particular the automotive sector in this country, which is part of the manufacturing fabric, employs 46,000 direct jobs nationally and another 200,000 jobs indirectly. This sector is vital to the economy of South Australia, the state I come from. I represent the region where, for over 60 years, the GM Holden plant has underpinned the economy. For the member for Indi to talk about patronising people in the manufacturing sector, when the opposition's policy, if elected, is to cut another $500 million from the automotive sector at a critical time when it is under intense pressure from overseas suppliers to build cars in this country, is hypocrisy at its worst. To say that we are patronising the manufacturing people is absolutely ludicrous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks I have seen total disarray on the coalition side, from state and federal MPs, on their views and policies with respect to the assistance they will provide manufacturers in this country, particularly in the automotive sector. I have listened to debate, comment and interview after interview from members opposite and it is clear that not only do they not have a policy but also they are in total disarray and in conflict with one another with respect to their position on this issue. The fact is that the $500 million which they would cut if elected to office is money that will be used to help vehicle and component makers get cleaner and greener products onto the market, the very thing research and development brings to this country, the very thing that will make manufacturers much more competitive and their products more saleable. Yet the area they are going to cut has a direct bearing on research investment in this country. They come into this chamber and pretend that they are taking a stand on behalf of our manufacturing sector. It really is hypocritical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, research is critical if we are to address the challenges that face our nation and the world—climate change, treating and eradicating disease, and improving productivity in the workforce, whether through the application of new technology or industrial arrangements that put workers in a mental 'space' where they will work more efficiently. Research helps us meet the eternal challenge of better understanding the world we live in. Research dedicated to improving our understanding of history helps us define our future by learning from our past. Research also helps us analyse the impact of social and economic policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent trends in higher education highlight the growing importance of Australian Research Council funding. It has been said that there now appears to be a stronger emphasis on teaching in university, rather than researching. However, scholars also have an important role to play in providing solid, objective information to inform public policy initiatives and programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Research Council is an important element of our higher education system. The 2010-11 financial year marks the completion of the first decade of the Australian Research Council. It is important to provide funding to strengthen Australia's research workforce. In 2001-02, the Australian Research Council administered a budget of $270 million. By 2010-11 that had grown to $714.5 million. Australia has a proud tradition in research of contributing to significant change. The bionic ear, otherwise known as Cochlear implant, is certainly one of our most significant contributions and the Australian Research Council funded the innovative, investigator-driven research that underpinned this invention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand a project started last year examines the effect on language development of children with Cochlear implants being in an oral environment. This research will provide information for parents and professionals to promote the best possible outcomes for children. Research is not just about innovation; it also helps us understand and assess the outcomes of earlier work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I expect that at some point in the future someone will stand in this House and speak of the breakthrough in medical treatment achieved through stem cell research. In November 2010, then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator the Hon. Kim Carr announced that Stem Cells Australia had been awarded a $21 million grant under the Special Research Initiative in Stem Cell Science. There is much evidence to suggest that the government's investment in research today will bring improvement to the lives of many people tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Research Council has supported work that has made a difference to the lives of Australians in a diverse range of areas. These include research into the use of chemical residues from bomb blasts, in an era of homemade explosives, which will help catch terrorists; research that will improve predictions of Australian rainfall extremes using Indian Ocean surface temperatures; research that will allow us to successfully manage copyright in the digital age; research of strategies to improve child development and family wellbeing in disadvantaged communities before crime or serious behaviour problems emerge or become entrenched; research that has provided insight into the human appetite for protein, which can predispose us to obesity and other problems; research into the design of offshore structures that can survive catastrophic weather events like Hurricane Katrina; research of strategies to preserve the world's coral reefs; and research of minerals technology being used by global mining giants, saving money and increasing profits. These are just some examples of the research projects currently carried out by the Australian Research Council. I could refer to many more. I am pleased to say that only last week, in a hearing of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, the Environment and the Arts, we heard from some of the scientists who are carrying out this research. What they are doing and the information they are providing the government, which in turn will be invaluable in assisting us with developing policies for the future, is a credit to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk briefly about some of the research being carried out in my home state of South Australia under Australian Research Council grants. The University of Adelaide was awarded $19.85 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 60 projects, and $47.28 million for 71 projects in 2011. I also note that the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics is based at the University of Adelaide's Waite Campus, with additional research nodes at the University of Adelaide, the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland and the University of South Australia. The centre was established in 2002 and is jointly funded by the Australian Research Council and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. Flinders University in South Australia was awarded $3.42 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 12 projects. It is interesting to note that Flinders University hosts the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training, which is jointly funded by the Australian Research Council and the National Groundwater Commission. This is an area I have a personal interest in, and I understand the importance of this area of public policy. The centre, which also has research nodes at the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and the University of Queensland, was established in June 2009 with Commonwealth funding of $29.5 million over five years. The ARC has awarded the University of South Australia $6.66 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 22 projects, including a Discovery Indigenous scheme. It is important to note the role the Australian Research Council has been and is playing in attracting more Indigenous Australians to academia, as well as the role that it plays in keeping more women in research careers. To enhance support for world-class female researchers, Prime Minister Gillard announced in 2010 that two new Australian Laureate Fellowships would be offered to highly ranked female candidates. Strong role models undoubtedly help attract people who do not come from backgrounds traditionally associated with research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also talk about the centres of excellence that have been funded under this program. I understand some 25 centres of excellence have been established over the years, ranging from things like climate change to the history of emotions, from cognition and its disorders to plant cell wall biology, and so on. Again, these centres of excellence provide invaluable advice for government policy setting into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left to speak on this issue I want to talk about two people associated with these Australian centres of excellence. One is Peter Hoj, who was chief executive of the centres from 2004 to 2007. Peter is now the Vice Chancellor and president of the University of South Australia. Since his appointment to that role, taking over from Denise Bradley in 2007, he has done an outstanding job. I have worked with Peter on a number of different projects in the region and not only am I pleased to see that he is now in South Australia working for the University of South Australia—a university that has a campus in my own electorate—but also I commend him and his team for the work they are doing in engaging so many additional people in university vocations and university education. In particular the work they are doing on community engagement between the university and the broader community is something that they can all be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other person I want to comment on is Professor Peter Buckskin, who I understand has now been appointed to the council. I know Professor Peter Buckskin through his work in South Australia, both in the education sector and as an adviser to state and federal governments over the years. I am pleased to see that Professor Buckskin has been appointed to the council. I wish him well in that role and I think he will make a fine contribution. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  I rise to support the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. I have been fortunate in my experiences to be a partner with industry, tertiary institutions and researchers in accessing ARC grants that focus on making a difference not only to the quality of life of Australians but also within fields of work that require Australia and Australian society to better position ourselves within a global context. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Makin for his comments. I acknowledge those that I agree with but there are certainly some that I disagree with—I will not dwell on those; the beauty of democracy is that we have the opportunity to differ in philosophical positioning. I compliment the government on the indexing, at a rate of approximately 3.4 per cent, because that enhances the expectations of researchers that there is a source of funding that will enable them to undertake the work that is absolutely critical in benefiting the society in which we live. The additional financial year will be funded at $795.392 million, which is a reduction of four per cent from the previous financial year. But the expansion of the program through its extension is absolutely critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Research Council's mission is to deliver policies and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and that benefit the community. We can develop a mindset about what it is that we should accept within the short planning cycles of terms of governments. Sometimes I wish we could look beyond that and look over a decade, and look at the reality of some of the research that is needed to position Australia globally and enable us to be productive, efficient and a leader through innovation and technology.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a statutory authority within the Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education portfolio, there is an expectation that the ARC will influence the key areas that form the basis of the way the Australian society moves forward. I have always supported the intent of the ARC. It promotes the highest quality research and research training through national competition in all fields of science, social sciences and humanities. Coupled with the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council, there are two significant avenues through which researchers can access funding in partnership with tertiary institutions and industry to undertake work that is absolutely critical in changing and making life better for all of us. I like the way the ARC brokers partnerships between researchers and industry, governments, community organisations and the international community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly support the ongoing funding allocated to the National Competitive Grants Program because of the way it encourages Australian researchers. It nurtures the creative abilities and skills of Australia's most promising researchers and provides support for high-quality research leading to the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of knowledge. This is absolutely vital if we are going to be a world leader. Financial assistance for facilities and equipment that researchers need to be internationally competitive is invaluable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a few comments concerning the health arena. I have had a lot to do with the Sax Institute in New South Wales and Fiona Stanley's Telethon Institute for Child Health Research in Western Australia. Nurturing the capacity and capability of researchers to build on the social fabric and contribute to reform, change and innovation are very worthy, and something that we should strongly support and always endorse on a bipartisan basis. The ongoing funding will provide incentives for Australia's most talented researchers to work in partnership with leading researchers throughout the national innovation system and internationally, and to form alliances with Australian industry across the following interdisciplinary groupings: biological sciences and biotechnology, where there is much expansion occurring; engineering, mathematics and informatics; humanities and creative arts; physics, chemistry and earth sciences; and social, behavioural and economic sciences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Makin touched on a number of programs. I will not go into detail on those, but I want to explore the opportunities that we will have from this amended legislation and the programs that it establishes. The ARC is important because of the changing world in which we live and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on industry, and the opportunities that it delivers for our researchers to capitalise on emerging trends that cover every facet of our lives, our industries and our economy. The growing influence of globalisation will continue to increase competition and lower profit margins in many countries whilst at the same time centralising wealth and power in a diminishing number of supernational corporate giants. I see the opportunity for our researchers to look at the way they contribute to international growth and, at the same time, through innovation generate wealth and new jobs within the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Globalisation is a means to the levelling of the playing field for trade and we are progressing the concept of a flat earth for economic development, trade and the sciences. The threat that jobs could go abroad lies behind job insecurity, the erosion of non-wage benefits and the loss of manufacturing in Australia. These are critical issues and I see researchers as being pivotal in creating new industries and new manufacturing opportunities in this country in fields that we have not yet explored, but in their minds they are thinking about the prospects and opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The digital age and other technologies are triggering a massive increase in productivity along with the rapid downsizing in manufacturing and the deflation of costs. Knowledge management under this funding will make a difference between the growth of Australia and the survival in a virtual future, because that is a reality that we face. The reality that also faces Australia in a global society is access to a sustainable domestic workforce and productivity efficiencies that will mitigate the impact of factors of globalisation, an ageing workforce, inflexible work arrangements, young Australians wanting quality of life, the urban influence not rural and a diminishing manufacturing sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read with great interest the work of Patrick Dixon, the author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurewise</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>I will cite three of his comments because they relate to factors that encourage our researchers and recipients of ARC funding to explore opportunities for our country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, in those projects that I have been involved in with ARC grants, that has been the thinking of the researchers, so I am extremely supportive of the funding and the increase in funding, and the indexation that the government has proposed in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In <span style="font-style:italic;">Visions of the Future: the intelligence revolution</span>, the first of a three-part mini series on the BBC hosted by Michio Kaku, he says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this century, we are going to make the historic transition from the 'Age of Discovery' to the 'Age of Mastery', a period in which we will move from being passive observers of nature to its active choreographers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is that element coming within the scope of the work that researchers will do. The fourth of the top five predictions in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Futurist </span>magazine is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Professional knowledge will become obsolete almost as quickly as it's acquired. An individual's professional knowledge is becoming outdated at a much faster rate than ever before.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The partnerships between industries, tertiary institutions, researchers and the non-government organisations in a sense militate against this because they will look at, and explore, the opportunities for the expansion of knowledge that is applicable to the economy and to the society which we hope to shape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">James Canton in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Extreme Future </span>identifies a significant focus and opportunity on the importance of innovation, particularly in globalisation; new technology; IT and networks, such as microchips and computers; biotech—unlocking the DNA to create health discoveries; nanotech—the manipulation of matter at the atomic scale; new fuels, drugs and machines; and neurotech—such as new devices, drugs and materials to heal, manage and enhance mental performance and functioning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Researchers explore the boundaries that go outside the square. They use the opportunity to look at the 'what ifs' and then turn them into practical application that can become a process by which manufacturing industries and education knowledge acquisition, with skilling, account for different directions that will occur in the future. We only have to hark back to the past to see that labour intensive jobs are no longer required. That all has occurred because of the work that researchers have undertaken. It has enabled us to develop new ways of doing the work that we do, gaining efficiencies, obtaining productivity levels that generate the wealth that gives us and creates the standard of living that we look forward to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read with interest both speeches delivered in the House by the minister. Many of the comments in there underpin the direction that we, in a bipartisan approach, must take if we are to ensure that future generations have the quality and standard of living that we have enjoyed for a number of years. If we project into our thinking for researchers the need to focus not only on 2010 or 2015 or 2020 but on the next 50 years and start to project into the future then we are likely to see the creation of innovative ideas by researchers. They will apply knowledge to the implications and impact on societies and families, and then shape advice to governments at all levels. That then enables the society or community to enjoy the benefits of what it is that we provide and protect. We can give them a solid foundation for the expectations that they would have to bring up families and communities in future years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill and I acknowledge the intent. I certainly look forward to the outcomes that researchers will achieve in the context of the work that they do, and the gains that they will make, that makes life in this country so rich, rewarding and enabling.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. How will we ensure that making healthier choices gets easier? How will adapting to climate change impact on our health? How will new urban spaces support health? How will children grow into adulthood to embrace new sustainable ways of living? How will communities change to support ageing? How will we relate to each other in a world of new communication technologies? How will safe and supportive communities grow to everyone's benefit in a globally connected world? How will local communities ensure a fair go for everyone as economic and social conditions change? What will a healthy workplace look like in the future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all questions posed by Professor Robert Bush, who is the Director of Healthy Communities Research Centre at the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. I will speak more about that centre a little later. It is a centre which has received funding from the Australian Research Council, as has the University of Queensland generally—and I will talk a bit about that. It is important that we look at questions like that. They are posed to us as questions for the 21st century; not as questions for the 20th century. The adaptations and decisions that people will make in the 21st century are vastly different from those of the 20th century and 19th century. We need to pay particular attention to life span, the multicultural aspect of our community, the fast-growing demographic areas such as my electorate with Ipswich and the Somerset region of South-East Queensland—two of the three fastest-growing areas in South-East Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to pay attention to local government places and spaces, parks and gardens, recreational facilities and infrastructure—places that connect people; places that bring people together for fellowship and friendship. We need to look at our communities and how we can design them better. We need to look at the healthy aspects of our communities. These are all things that do not just happen by chance or happenstance. They happen because we provide funding for research to give us the answers. People like Robert Bush and others deserve the funding. They need it and we need to provide it for them. One of the projects being undertaken by the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus is the Ipswich Study and I will talk a bit more about that later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes amendments to the Australian Research Council Act 2001. As other speakers have said, this amendment to the act to is to apply indexation to the funding administered by the ARC. The Research Council does important work and, through the National Competitive Grants Program, supports quality research—research which has applicability and an impact on communities, families and individuals. It includes research in areas such as the bionic ear, which the member for Makin talked about. Ongoing research will make a big difference not only to local communities but to higher education. Not only will it provide employment but it will provide answers to the questions posed by Professor Robert Bush.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of initiatives and innovations funded by the ARC through the NCGP and we have to make sure that research is provided so that we do not lag behind. Many years ago Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of Singapore, said that Australia would become the white trash of Asia. That has not happened because we have taken steps to transform the economy and this government is now transforming our economy in a way that is cleaner and greener. We are making a difference to the future. We are making decisions for the 21st century, not for the high-pollution, high-carbon 20th century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ARC supports high-quality research. It provides grants to organisations. One of those institutions, which I am proud to say I attended and proud to say happens to be in my electorate, is the University of Queensland—the Ipswich campus. Recently, the University of Queensland received $430,000 in research funding for the Healthy Communities Research Centre based at Ipswich campus. That project is being funded through the National Competitive Grants Program and the funding for it is an example of what this legislation covers and it shows why indexation is critical. This particular successful proposal is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Averting the extinction of experience</span> and was submitted in collaboration with Dr Richard Fuller from the University of Queensland's School of Biological Sciences and the CSIRO's Climate Adaptation Flagship project. The research focuses on how changes to urban biodiversity affect health and is just one of the many projects funded by the Health Communities Research Centre at the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus. That campus is known, and that particular research centre is known, for its headline project, the Ipswich Study. I would hope that projects like the Ipswich Study will advance our knowledge, build our research capability and enhance international collaboration. It is important that we harness the creativity of our whole people and enhance the creative abilities and skills of our most promising researchers at places like the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus. The $430,000 I mentioned will enable the best and brightest researchers to make exciting and critical discoveries, will help forge those kinds of international partnerships and will showcase our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 1,000 projects were funded in this round of Australian Research Council major grants and they will share in about $310 million. The University of Queensland received over $38 million for 120 different projects. That included nearly $29.8 million for 92 projects under the Discovery Projects scheme, nearly $2 million for six projects under the Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities funding scheme and nearly $6.3 million for 22 projects under the Linkage Projects scheme. The University of Queensland is one of the sandstone universities and the campus at Ipswich has a medical school, a nursing school and allied health professional education. It is also the location of the University of Queensland's own GP superclinic, run by UQ, which was a great assistance to my local community during the floods last year. This research will make a difference to my community and to communities around the world. Robert Bush, whom I mentioned before, said that this project is really important and that he backed it 100 per cent. He described the funding as fantastic—to see the local centre achieve such a prestigious award and obtain research funding through the grants process. He talked about the potential for this sort of work to contribute to the health of Ipswich and beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Healthy Communities Research Centre clearly has runs on the board and can do a lot of good. Neighbourhoods, whether in Australia or abroad, influence the way communities operate, particularly in the critical area of health. I am always struck by the fact, when I jog around my neighbourhood at Flinders View and up around Raceview, Ripley and places like that, that there are many pathways. I see plenty of people jogging or walking their dog or just going for a walk themselves on those pathways. But, in other parts of Ipswich, I do not see the same pathways and I do not see people exercising. How can communities and local governments make a difference to reducing the problems of obesity and diabetes? These are the sorts of issues and questions that the University of Queensland's Ipswich Study will look into. Ipswich is a microcosm—it is a fast-developing area. Most of Ipswich is rural and many people do not realise that. It has a big manufacturing base in central Ipswich and the eastern suburbs, but most of it is rural. It has a very diverse community. There are about 175,000 people or a bit more—perhaps 180,000—and the member for Oxley and I share the care of it in representing it here in this place. We have implemented in Ipswich a number of projects to improve health and wellbeing and this government has put a lot of money into assisting Ipswich, including Ipswich General Hospital, which has close linkages to the University of Queensland. We have put $7 million into the redevelopment of Ipswich General Hospital and recently we have put in $16 million towards palliative care and other assistance in terms of rehabilitation. The now Attorney-General, a former Minister for Health and Ageing, was with me when we looked around at that particular project. So we have put a lot of money into that, but it is those partnerships between the University of Queensland's health research centre and the teaching facility at Ipswich General Hospital and the ARC, with the funding, that will make a difference in my local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes we come to this place and talk about big picture issues, but I want to narrow it all down and say what this will do and what this type of funding will do for my local community. I look forward to more than 10,000 Ipswich families taking part in this 10-year study. That will benefit not just the Ipswich community but also business, government and international research. Robert Bush tells me that the last time that a study of this longitudinal nature and research were really undertaken was in the US about 40 or 50 years ago. So this Ipswich study, which already has funding from the Ipswich Hospital Foundation, Bendigo Bank, Ipswich City Council, chambers of commerce and research grants, is really important and I am urging the government to consider this sort of funding. It is done on a bipartisan basis and it is really important that we get behind this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Llew Edwards, a former state member for Ipswich born and bred in Ipswich and a former Liberal Deputy Premier of Queensland and a former Chancellor of the University of Queensland, is a real backer of the Ipswich Study. He has made the point that the city 'is on the move' and 'heading towards a population boom'. He has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This … study goes beyond simply recognising that neighbourhoods influence health and into understanding exactly how.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that comment of his says it well, and I think that is the benefit of the research. It is about how we can build a sustainable Australia, how we can build communities that are not ghettos on the urban fringe and periurban areas of our country, and how we can look at taking advantage of what we have got in terms of mineral resources and making it all fairer and also making our local communities connected to each other. So I am very pleased to support this legislation. I am pleased to support the ARC and I am glad it has made a commitment to the University of Queensland and I am glad it has made a commitment to the research centre in my electorate and as, I am glad that it is located there, I urge the government to consider the Ipswich Study as something worth funding in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="96430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EWEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  On a personal note, I would like to thank the member for Blair and the member for Moreton for the job that they do on the committee looking at insurance that went to Townsville. They have done a great job up there along with the coalition guys. I rise to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. The prime purpose of this bill is to apply indexation to the Australian Research Council's—or ARC's—existing funding schemes.    Specifically, this bill involves the changing of three current financial year funding figures to account for an indexation of roughly 3.4 per cent. As with the member for Blair, I have a university and lots of training centres and lots of ARC schemes in my electorate and I would love to support them. So, if you have anything to do with it, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, I would discount everything that the member for Blair has said, because my stuff is going to be so much better. This bill will also extend the forward estimate period to include the financial year beginning 1 July 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this is a routine bill to index the ARC's funding schemes, it is nevertheless important to Australia, particularly to Townsville, which has become a vital research hub for regional Australia and the tropics. My first experience with the ARC on a committee basis was here in Parliament House when we sat around a table with the ARC people. When I asked them what they did, one of the things that they came up with was this. A business came to them and said, 'Where a building is not structurally damaged by fire the biggest expense is rewiring it.' So the ARC people had gone away and said, 'Okay, how do we do this?' What they came up with was a casing for the wiring when it goes into a building that under intense heat will turn into a ceramic, thus protecting the wiring. My head exploded and I said, 'Who could come up with that? Where do you think of these things?' As the member for Hasluck said, we train these people and these people are special in our society because they can think outside of the box, they can think about what can happen and throw things up in the air and see what stays there. That is what is great about the ARC schemes. People like me have no vision as to that whatsoever. I have absolutely no ability for thinking outside the box at all. I can fix the box, I can fix anything inside the box, I can tinker with it and I can change it, but if it is outside the box I am gone! That is why the ARC schemes are so important. If we are to be the smart country, if we are to be the innovators and really add to the Asian century, we must do it through research and development. As the member for Indi said, research and development must become the cornerstone of our economic growth. We must find new ways and new products, as the member for Makin said, and the cochlear implant is a fantastic example of what an ARC scheme can bring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville we have the main campus of James Cook University. It is a world renowned body for its marine biology research and also for its focus on life in a tropical world. With around half of the world's population living in the tropics, JCU's work in the fields of tropical health, biodiversity and science is a central part of the university and of Townsville's contribution to the international community. It is important to note, on the 60th anniversary of the accession of the Queen to the throne, that it is the only university in Australia to have its proclamation physically signed by the Queen. James Cook University is the only university in Australia which has at its core life in a tropical world, so everything that is done at James Cook University is aimed at life in a tropical world to the extent that there is a wholly owned campus in Singapore which attracts university students from Europe wanting the Asian experience but with an Australian university degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the examples of the research that can come out of James Cook University is this. It is a field accident injection unit, which instantly clots blood. It was designed with the battlefield in mind. If someone is injured on the battlefield they are given an injection, like Nebupent, and it slows down the bleeding, it clots the blood, allowing you to transport them. Its implications for battle were obvious, but the implications for the farm, where the most dangerous implements are the chainsaw and a PTO instrument, are very well known to everyone. Distance is the killer and a piece of equipment like this injection unit is so handy. It should be developed throughout Australia. That they are struggling for funding shows just how vital this funding becomes, because we do have people out there wanting to do the work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ARC is a major source of funding for university based research, including at JCU through its grants programs, such as the Future Fellowships scheme and the Linkage Projects, which partner industry up with the research community. James Cook University has a great history of and passion for PhD students, because that is the research and those are the programs that are funded and bring research dollars into town. In places like ATSIP, the Australian Tropical Sciences and Innovation Precinct, practical and tangible research is bringing real progress to everything from the better use of our water resources to cattle and food production in a tropical environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While looking at this bill I have been in touch with Professor Chris Cocklin, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Innovation, at JCU. Professor Cocklin emphasised the significance that indexing in ARC funding has to universities to ensure that they are able to maintain their level of research. In particular, he pointed out the burden that increased administration costs have had on universities and their ability in recent times to deliver maximum benefits from research funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, whilst the Australian Institute of Marine Science is getting funding for research, their operating expenses are shrinking. So, whilst they are getting more research money to go to sea for research, they are not getting the fuel to power the boats. That is where the cuts have to come. It is critical that we ensure funding for all research programs is spent in actual research and not just caught up in the organisation of these programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville and JCU are also the headquarters of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, which joins JCU with the Australian National University, the University of Queensland, the University of Western Australia, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the last two of which are also key research hubs based in Townsville. The ARC's funding of the centre of excellence is of great importance to Townsville and to the Great Barrier Reef. Townsville's proximity to the reef makes it a natural home for coral reef studies and for PhD students and researchers from around the world. I spoke recently with one of the chief scientists at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, who reinforced to me the importance that the centre's research has to the management of the Great Barrier Reef, which is recognised internationally as being one of the best managed marine parks in the world. Much of the work undertaken by the centre of excellence is able to feed back through to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and it underpins the park's management. This connection between research and frontline operations in Townsville is one of the elements that has made this such a successful program. Every member I have heard speak on this bill has alluded to the fact that we are seeing these practical experiences and examples of what our smarter people are bringing into our economy. As a government and as a parliament we are all speaking with one voice and saying that we do need research for this thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville I also spoke with the director of the centre of excellence, Professor Terry Hughes, about the contribution this program makes to coral reef research, with the centre of excellence's network around the country being the world's largest provider of coral reef training and research. Professor Hughes also mentioned to me that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the funding of this program into the future. As the member for Hasluck said, it would be fantastic to sit here and say that they have funding for 50 years, or for 10 years, and that we are thinking long term. But we inside this place are all realists and we know that governments have the right to change priorities and change processes. Whilst we ask a lot of people to commit—and we ask them that when they do commit they do so wholly and solely to these things—a lot of the time it is a very hard thing to ask them to do because funding does dry up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Marine Science also plays a major role in Townsville's marine science research community. While their main connection with the ARC is through the centre of excellence, their collaborations with JCU and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority nevertheless mean that they benefit from an increase in funding for research in Townsville. There are some very exciting things happening at the Australian Institute of Marine Science. For example, there is the ocean simulator, which is attracting attention from PhD students and fellows from around the world wanting to see what is happening. We are getting to the stage where we can commercially produce lobsters in-house. We are breeding lobsters in-house and we are getting them from the larval stage to the wriggler stage and then all the way through. This is a fantastic program. It is world-leading research that has the whole world excited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funnily enough, when it comes to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, we have the Protect our Coral Sea petition going around. No doubt every member in this House has seen something of it. It is the PEW foundation—and the PEW foundation is not a rabid green organisation that just wants to shut things down—that is pushing for the closure of the Coral Sea and turning it into a national park. Not James Cook University, AIMS or the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority were asked to participate in this research. Given that we are talking about an area of over one million square kilometres, it is something we should be questioning. We should be questioning the motives behind the PEW foundation's research. Even more importantly, there has been very little research done on the Coral Sea. The most quantitative research we ever received was from when we were able to tag rides with the Japanese fishing fleets that operated there through the 1970s and into the 1980s, but that was phased out, starting with the Fraser-Howard government and then into the Hawke-Keating era. Even more importantly, if we are to have the ARC guide us, we really should ensure that they are part of the process. Townsville has become a key centre for research in the tropics, and any measures that affect government funding for research have significant consequences for the city and for our research institutions. We all wish that we had a bottomless pit from which we could pull money for the funding of research. There will always be that line in the sand. It is up to the government of the day to say where that line in the sand is drawn. As much as I would like to quip, 'As long as it is drawn making sure that everything from Townsville is in there,' I do understand that there are priorities that have to be made. I think we are all aware that, whilst there are very, very good causes here which will miss funding, there has to be a line drawn in the sand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would like to go back to what the members for Hasluck, Blair and Makin said, and no doubt the member for Canberra will be saying it as well. If we are to be the truly innovative people that we know we are, if we are to foster Australian researchers who can think outside the box, who can come up with ideas and make them practical, tangible, positive, income-producing schemes, we must make sure that we give people every chance to do their research, to progress their research, to come up with examples. We know that there will be economic benefits in the long term. With that in mind, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 tonight, because the ACT has a very large stake in research. The ANU is one of the greatest research institutions in the world. The University of Canberra is also a great research institution. And I have the Mount Stromlo Observatory in my electorate, which conducts some phenomenal research into what is going on in outer space. This government has made a significant investment in the Mount Stromlo Observatory. When bushfires ravaged the south of Canberra, in my electorate, the observatory was largely burnt out. It was just a shell up there. We have made significant investment in that area now. We have got the greatest technology, new buildings and it is ever expanding, with more and more people driving up that little hill each day to go and do great work for the nation and for the world. So it is a great pleasure to be able to speak on this amendment bill tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the statutory authority within the innovation portfolio, the Australian Research Council plays an important role in advancing Australian research and innovation globally, while also supporting the highest quality research and training through the fields of science, social sciences and the humanities. The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill will help us continue to support excellence in research and to build our nation's research capacity. We are already at the forefront of the world in great research, particularly in the agricultural sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was in Afghanistan early last year—in May, I think it was—it was really interesting talking to a number of people there about what we can contribute in providing advice and assistance in the agricultural sector to build up the local capacity in Afghanistan. They have great skills in growing, developed over centuries and centuries on small plots of land, in really rough conditions. They have stinking hot summers. It is 50 degrees in summer and it is minus 50 degrees in winter, so we are talking pretty rugged conditions. In some parts of Australia we get extreme weather, but we do not usually get extreme hot and extreme cold in the course of the year. In speaking to people there, I learned they have this great capacity to grow almonds, dates and apricots, but they do not have the capacity to make it a large business. We have the ability not just to improve productivity, through the research that we do, but also to give advice on capacity building for businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have great, great research that has allowed this country to prosper, particularly in the agricultural sector over the course of this nation's history. I am thinking particularly of the great research that the CSIRO has done in wheat, to allow enormous boosts in production, by 40 per cent over time. We have great skills in this area and it is great that we have this technology and research capacity that we can export overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this amendment bill will alter three existing financial year funding figures for indexation and extend the forward estimates period to include the financial year starting on 1 July 2014, resulting in additional spending of $885 million over the four financial years. As I mentioned, the ARC has a long history and it is something that the Gillard government is proud to continue to support. Although this amendment to administer vital funding occurs each year, it is a great reminder to all of us of the importance of research to our nation's future and of how this research can deliver cultural, economic, social and environmental benefits to all our citizens and—I have just mentioned the case of Afghanistan—the citizens of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must ensure that Australian researchers, who do such important work, can continue to be internationally competitive. One way the ARC ensures this is through the National Competitive Grants Program, a program that nurtures our future scientists and researchers and ensures they have incentives to stay here in Australia. It is vitally important that we keep these great minds in our country, doing great work for Australia. The program does this by supporting the highest quality research, which leads to the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of knowledge. It also provides financial assistance towards facilities and equipment that our researchers need so they can continue to be internationally competitive. It also supports training and skills development for our next generation of researchers. In addition, it provides incentives for Australia's most talented researchers to work in partnership with leading national and international researchers and to form alliances with Australian industry, which is so important. We do not need people coming up with great ideas in the research area which are then just planted in a Petri dish or become some concept sitting on a shelf; the ideas need to be utilised in some meaningful way, and that is where these partnerships with industry are so important. Australians can be proud of the work our researchers do. Many significant global advances have been achieved by Australians working under the auspices of the ARC. Not only has the ARC supported some of our most well-known innovations, such as the bionic ear—a great invention—and the Jameson Flotation Cell, which continues to save the coal industry billions of dollars each year; the organisation also continues to push the boundaries to discover what is possible, what is unthought-of, what is out there, what is the potential that we will inherit. It is working hard to advance science and research more broadly and to ensure that the abilities and skills of Australia's most promising researchers are nurtured and promoted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to report that in 2012 funding will allow the ARC to continue its Australian Laureate Fellowships Scheme, which reflects the Commonwealth's commitment to support excellence in research by attracting world-class researchers and research leaders to key positions by creating new rewards and incentives for the application of their talents in Australia. I am even more delighted to report that, for funding commencing in 2012, up to 17 Australian Laureate Fellowships will be awarded, including an additional two fellowships for successful female Australian Laureate Fellows. Recipients of these fellowships will be provided with the Australian Laureate Fellowship funding, plus additional funding to undertake an ambassadorial role to promote women in research. This is an issue in which I have become very interested in recent years, more so since I have become the member for Canberra and even more so because of the nature of the population in Canberra and its very strong research community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My little sister is a research neurologist. She has done some great research on strokes as well as in a range of other areas. One thing that she has highlighted to me, as have her colleagues and other women in Canberra who are in this field, is that women in the early stages of their career find research grants quite accessible. It is when they go into the phase where they have had a few babies and they want some part-time work that their publication rate reflects the part-time nature of their work. They do not have as many publications as their male colleagues who have not had babies, who have not taken a bit of time off work or who have not gone part-time. Of course, you cannot compare a part-time mother and her publication rate with a full-time male researcher. So there is an in-built discrimination in terms of their ability to get grants as a result of their not being able to publish as much as their male colleagues. There are also some other systemic issues here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been doing a great deal, as have research councils such as the NHMRC, to improve the number of women, particularly those at that mid-career level, in the research industry and improve their access to grants. It is vitally important that young women go into this field. We need more women in science. We need more women in research. These young women go into this field with bright ideas, great ideas, and with aspirations. So early in their career they need to incentives to stay in the research field and to continue to stay in it right throughout their career. They should not have their careers stopped as a result of their choice to have babies and work part-time. These fellowships are very welcome news, and I applaud the ARC for instituting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure is important because, at the inception of the Australian Laureate Fellowships Scheme, in 2008, only 12.8 per cent of the applicants were female and, in 2009, 17.5 per cent were female. The ARC continues to work hard to improve the research funding opportunities for women and, as I said, not just at the beginning of their careers but throughout their careers. I believe these additional fellowships will go a long way to promoting women in research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Discovery Early Career Researcher Award will also continue this year. This is another way that the ARC is working hard to support and advance our promising researchers who are in the early stages of their careers. Proposals are now open for this funding to commence in 2013. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ARC is also working to advance the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders working in research and innovation. Funding will commence this year for the Special Research Initiative for the ATSI Researchers' Network. The network's core functions will be to build Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research capacity, mentor new researchers and advance research in Indigenous knowledge systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as supporting Australian research and ensuring incentives for research at home, the ARC is also supporting research that will have a long-term impact on the lives of Australian families. The ARC is working to support our ageing population, which is so important, through its population ageing research. This research will transform thinking about population ageing, inform private and public sector policy and yield outcomes that will improve the wellbeing of the aged and their social and economic environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The organisation is also on track to deliver the bionic eye—a breakthrough that will be welcome news for people suffering progressive vision loss. With an ageing population, that number will probably only go up. This initiative was one of many that came out of the government's 2020 Summit here, in Canberra, in 2009. The ARC awarded $50 million for this special research initiative. The technology is now at the point of being tested, and this is just one year after funding began. It just goes to show what our Australian researchers can do with the funding we are providing to them with this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the ARC has committed funding for a total of 778 proposals for Discovery Projects—that is, funding for research projects that can be undertaken by individual researchers or research teams. I am proud to say that 93 of those grants were issued to researchers from the Australian National University and the University of Canberra in the ACT alone. In 2012, more than $327,000 has been granted to researchers at the ANU to examine factors that may improve the mental health of welfare recipients, promote employment outcomes and help the Commonwealth government develop welfare reform policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANU has also been awarded $420,000 for research into next-generation tsunami warnings. This project will generate the science for rapid tsunami forecasts to maintain public confidence in tsunami warnings, enabling emergency managers around the world to make well-informed decisions about imminent tsunamis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, $390,000 will be given to the ANU for the very first digital imaging survey of the entire sky of the Southern Hemisphere. It is amazing. This work will underpin a number of significant national science programs of international prominence, and I am sure that it will be one of them. The survey will be carried out using the university's SkyMapper telescope near Coonabarabran. It was built to replace the ANU's previous telescope located at Mount Stromlo Observatory, which was sadly destroyed in the 2003 bushfires. According to the ANU's Professor of Astronomy, the ultimate plan is to create a database that will be accessible for anyone in the world. Astronomers anywhere will be able to learn about the characteristics of the Southern Hemisphere stars and galaxies. It is very exciting. At the University of Canberra, $210,000 has been committed to researchers examining productivity and work-life balance in virtual work environments, helping to unlock the impact technology is having on our ability to have a life outside of work. I would be very interested to see what the outcomes of that research will be. I know none of us are strangers to work interrupting our family, particularly with the technology we have now, so this will be of interest to many people, I am sure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all, more than $32 million has been invested in researchers here in the ACT this year. This funding will go towards a range of projects from disciplines as diverse as pure mathematics—which was a huge challenge for me at school—to historical studies and everything in between. This is a significant investment in research and I commend the ARC for making that investment in Canberra. It is important to remember the contribution researchers make to the future of Canberra, and indeed Australia. Our research holds the key to our growing and developing economy. It helps shape our jobs of the future, and ensures we can better protect and understand our natural environment. Through research we can better educate our children, heal our sick and discover new opportunities—new worlds, like we are with the Southern Hemisphere stars—to help our local communities grow in a more sustainable way and to help the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="217266" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. Although this is a routine change to the Australian Research Council Act 2001 which occurs annually, the bill continues to update and contribute to the important work that the ARC provides for innovation and research in Australia. This amendment, which the coalition supports, adds indexation to current financial year funding figures and extends the forward estimate period to the year commencing 1 July 2014. Specifically, this bill will add indexation at approximately 3.4 per cent, which will cost $89 million and fund the extra financial year at a cost of $795 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Research Council was established in 2001 under the Howard government as recognition of the need to have a centralised body to coordinate linkages between government, industry, the community and researchers. As the ARC itself states, its mission is to 'deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community'. The ARC runs many very successful initiatives, including the National Competitive Grants Program, which provides support and financial assistance as well as other incentives to form national aid linkages with researchers around the world. In particular, it is a comprehensive program that recognises the different stages at which various researchers may be in their career. Similarly, the ARC supports research and training through the National Research Priorities scheme and Discovery Projects on top of other laureate and future fellowships and Indigenous-specific programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the advancements that can occur from research projects can be quite unpredictable and result from the inherent risk involved with scientific research. This will continue to be the case in the future and, as such, it is certainly one area where the government can make a significant contribution to projects that might have otherwise never found private funding. But it is also an area where government can make gains. As I have noted previously, it is estimated, for example, that for every dollar invested into medical research up to six dollars is returned on top of the initial investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders were understandably concerned last year when the Gillard government proposed to cut funding to the tune of $400 million as a direct result of their inability to design a responsible budget. I reiterate to the House today my concern at the thought of decreasing funding to what is an integral program for the future of Australia's research, innovation and industry. I do note that over the forward estimates the additional year included in the bill from 2014 is costed at approximately $795 million, which will in fact be a reduction of 4 per cent from the previous financial year. Although the coalition does support the passage of the bill, I and the coalition will always be looking at how we can adequately fund the ARC so that it is able to effectively and efficiently deliver on its mission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the strong support from members on both sides of the House today and their pride in what their local universities are achieving, we are all obviously in furious agreement about the need for guaranteed long-term funding. However, as the member for Indi remarked earlier, this Labor government is notoriously poor at providing linkages between research and industry. This particular aspect is perhaps the most important as it is the area where researchers and organisations are able to make financial and commercial returns from their work, returns that they are then able to reinvest and use to facilitate future research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appropriate planning and support for the Australian Research Council is especially important to the people of Ryan, as it is home to the University of Queensland. The University of Queensland is one of the premier research universities in Australia as a member of the Group of Eight. Indeed, it is one of the premier research organisations in the world, as judged by many international ranking publications. Since its inception, the Australian Research Council and the University of Queensland community have had a very strong relationship. Throughout that time, UQ has successfully been approved for many hundreds of projects through the various funding arms of the ARC. What distinguishes the University of Queensland as a leading research university is its depth and diversity across many faculties, from architecture to engineering, quantum physics, biomedical and molecular research as well as marine biology and research on sustainable living and environmental management strategies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today, Professor Max Lu, the Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor, updated me on many exciting ongoing research projects occurring at the University of Queensland. In 2011, the university placed first in the measure of ARC Discovery and Linkage projects outcomes, a wonderful achievement. Moreover, the University of Queensland placed second in the nation for both the Future Fellowships and Discovery Early Career Researcher Award, with 21 out of a possible 203 fellowships and 34 out of 277 discovery awards, each valued at $375,000. This highlights the strength of the many research teams at the University of Queensland. Certainly, the prospects for early career and midcareer researchers are extremely promising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Queensland has a particular focus on attracting and retaining international quality researchers, which adds further diversity to the pool of ideas that already exists in Australia and also contributes to the development of local scientists. Without these awards, the University of Queensland would simply not be able to attract the right researchers and the right ideas. Professor Lu himself has also received important funding from the ARC—including the very prestigious ARC Federation Fellowships twice, in 2003 and 2008—which has supported his world-class research into nanotechnology, materials chemistry and engineering. We are very fortunate to have Professor Lu at the university, and only with funding and support for research from organisations like the ARC are we able to attract and retain researchers of his ilk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also congratulate the University of Queensland on being awarded funding for two ARC Centres of Excellence, to add to its research in both quantum technology and environmental management solutions. Professor Gerard Milburn is training the next generation of world-class researchers in engineered quantum systems, and his team will be conducting research in conjunction with partners all over the world—in Austria, in Canada, in Germany, in Singapore, in Sweden, in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. We can all expect to see new devices and technologies which will drive Australia's, and the world's, productivity and economic growth in the future as a direct result of this cooperative research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Ryan I will continue to work with the University of Queensland community and all important stakeholders to ensure that the federal government continues to support, always, the crucial scientific industry in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  Recently I had the pleasure of meeting with Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt, who was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. As well as discussing his amazing research on the accelerating and expanding universe, we discussed the importance of science and research to Australia's future. More than anything else, Australia's future economic prosperity will rely on our capacity to harness the knowledge and innovation of our universities and our researchers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are living through an unprecedented mining boom, we must not lose sight of the negative impact the boom has on other sections of the economy. If our economy is to be more than just a quarry for China now and into the future, we must support innovation, science, research and development. The Greens also believe that government investment in research and science is critical to ensure that Australia is well positioned for a postcarbon economy. Innovations in science and technology through research are essential if we are to meet the challenges of addressing climate change and the transition to a sustainable society. So it is with great enthusiasm that on behalf of the Greens I rise to support the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011, which will enable indexation of funding to the Australian Research Council. Unfortunately, the last budget contained cuts to research funding, including $30 million from the cooperative research program, and there was no substantial new increase in funding. But at least the ARC was protected. The ARC plays a crucial and central role in support of research in Australia. It deserves increased support, and the Greens and I will always back its continued funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that we need a society where the acquisition of fundamental knowledge and the application of sustainable new techniques are valued in the education system and by Australian business. We need a research and development culture that addresses national goals and prepares Australia for emerging challenges and opportunities. But to achieve such goals we will need adequate support from both business and government. That is why the government needs to set a target for Australia's research and development. It needs to be a target that places us in the top ranks of the OECD, not languishing in the middle. It needs to be a target that sets us up to lead the world. That is why I believe the government needs to make a commitment to increase R&amp;D funding and to have a national goal of at least three per cent of GDP. That will require an increase in public funding and also a greater contribution from the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is widespread recognition of the need for a national target of at least three per cent. That is backed by the Australian Academy of Science, which has called for an increase in Australia's research and development expenditure to at least three per cent of GDP by 2020. While there has been an upward trend in overall expenditure on R&amp;D, this has largely been a result of increases in expenditure by the resources and energy sector, and the proportion of the government's contribution to the country's research effort has fallen dramatically from 22.6 per cent of total expenditure in 2000-2001 to 12.3 per cent in 2008-2009. In 2008-2009 this country had an expenditure of 2.21 per cent, which is below the OECD average of 2.33 per cent. That means that we spend as little as $900 per person per year on research and development, which puts us at 14th in the rankings of OECD member countries. We are well behind the next best ranked country, Iceland, which devotes 2.6 per cent of GDP to research and development. At the top of the list is Israel, with 4.6 per cent, followed by Finland and Sweden, each of which spends 3.6 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To remain competitive internationally we need even greater investment and, if we are to embrace the challenges and developments of this century, we must deliver internationally competitive R&amp;D. Research excellence is precious, but researchers are often in a battle for survival where costs are rising quicker than the level of funding and where career opportunities are limited. We want to encourage people to collaborate with those overseas and to go overseas themselves, but we hope that they will do that to further their scientific knowledge, not because there is no place for them here in Australia. Science research is often a long-term investment, but it is an investment that can pay off in spades. Late last year, the President of the Australian Academy of Science, Suzanne Cory, outlined some commercial successes created by the research of our world-class scientists. She referred in her list to WiFi, the bionic ear and Gardasiil. To focus on WiFi for a moment, she reminded us that the pioneering work of CSIRO scientist John O'Sullivan in radioastronomy led to the invention of WiFi—a beautiful example, she says, of how blue sky research can lead to commercial success in a totally unexpected area. This technology is absolutely integral to the way people all over the world use computers, printers, televisions and telephones. Indeed, it is now hard to imagine a world without WiFi and IT specialists predict that there will soon be more than one billion WiFi devices worldwide. She said that as of mid-2010 the WiFi patent had already netted CSIRO an estimated $250 million, which is being ploughed back into research and development via CSIRO's Science and Industry Endowment Fund. It is predicted to ultimately bring CSIRO upwards of $1 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To create the economic booms of the future we need to increase our investment in research and innovation. But we also need to increase our support for maths and science teaching in our schools and universities. I share the concerns of many that participation in maths and science education is declining and that the government's commitment is flagging. Australia ranks in the bottom half of OECD countries for the number of university graduates with science or engineering degrees. Consequently, I am also very concerned at the measures announced in the MYEFO that would almost double HECS fees for maths and science students. The government recognised the long-term need to encourage students into science and maths by introducing the priority HECS rates for science and maths in 2009. However, they did not take a long-term approach when they cancelled the priority rates last year. How could science and maths be a national priority three years ago and yet not now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When wealthy mining companies get close to $9 billion a year in handouts and tax concessions we should not be taking $400 million from science and maths education to balance the budget. The $400 million saving is a false economy if it means that science and maths are not taken up by our young people. Following government cuts to the Science in Schools program, the government is taking science education in the wrong direction. I am also concerned that the government used the report of the Bradley review to justify the HECS increase. HECS fees for sciences and maths were lowered in 2009 when they were made a national priority; however, the Bradley review was completed in December 2008.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concerns regarding the cuts are echoed by Universities Australia and by the Australian Academy of Science, who have noted that Australia's robust economic future depends upon innovation. This is not the time to withdraw support for the next generation of scientists and mathematicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the CSIRO announced its winners of the annual science awards. Two of the winners were a brother and sister, who won with solar-themed projects. Ethan Butson, 16, and his sister Macinley, 11, took out the high school and primary sections. The awards attracted more than 6,000 entries, with the top 15 students flown to Melbourne for a science workshop with some of the CSIRO's top science minds. It is young people like Ethan and Macinley who are the future of innovation in Australia and we need to nurture their minds and their careers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must spend more on research and science, not less. We must invest more in maths and science in our schools. I intend to be a fierce advocate for the importance of scientific research and the need for it to be adequately funded and supported and I will fight for the future of maths and science in our education system. That is why I support this bill and why I will support any move to increase funding to Australian research.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  It is my pleasure to speak on the Excise Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011 and the Customs Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011. The opposition will be supporting the passage of both of these bills. The Assistant Treasurer, now promoted to Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, introduced these bills on 23 November last year. In his introductory remarks he outlined briefly and concisely the purpose of these bills and I will recount it very briefly. Essentially, it is to make amendments so that taxpayers will be able to move to a weekly period with a preferred key day, which introduces some flexibility. In practice, the weekly reporting cycles have been beginning on Monday and ending on Sunday. The seven-day cycle will suit businesses and should reduce administration costs and allow them flexibility while still meeting the revenue needs of the Commonwealth. Critically, the amendments also allow for small business to apply for permission to defer their excise settlement to a monthly reporting cycle. Instead of reporting 52 times a year, they could, as the then Assistant Treasurer made clear, have the capacity to reduce lodgment paperwork from 52 to 12 returns a year. There are some other amendments, which I will not detain the House with, which relate to the seven-day reporting cycle as well, but they are in the same vein and reduce complexity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We regard these as sensible reforms and I do not mind saying that in this House. It is the case that the former Assistant Treasurer has introduced some sensible reforms, and you might be surprised to hear me say that. The main reason I say that is that he inherited the guts of these reforms—the monthly proposal to reduce the 52 returns per year to 12—when he was Labor's first Assistant Treasurer. The now Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, inherited these reforms because they were a budget announcement made by the former Howard government in 2007. I suppose the only surprise is that here we are many years later at the beginning of 2012 legislating what was an announcement made in May 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back three assistant treasurers—and I know my Assistant Treasurers—right back to the Hon. Peter Dutton, who announced on budget night 8 May 2007 a change where the government would allow small business with deferred settlement permissions to settle their excise and excise equivalent customs duties on a monthly cycle. If you go back to the budget papers of 2007—they were white back then and the main thing the current Treasurer did was change the colour to blue—the last white set, for those of us who keep budget papers, you see this announcement outlined in the measures document on page 12 in the revenue section.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After Labor had won government, at their first budget in 2008, all things being equal, you would have expected them to implement what we are now seeking to implement. There was a long joint press release from the current Treasurer and the then Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Mr Bowen, outlining the government's approach to a number of outstanding tax issues. It was affirmed in that press release in a very long schedule in item 32 that deferred settlement of excise and excise equivalent customs duties would be on a monthly cycle, rather than the existing weekly cycle. You can see the attachment for further details, for anyone who is interested. The pertinent point is that it was outlined in that press release that the legislation was not expected to be introduced before 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So in May 2008 clearly the government's intention was to proceed with this through 2009. We are now here at the beginning of 2012. Whilst the former Assistant Treasurer's introductory speech back in November pointed out in appropriate detail how this legislation would operate, it did omit the history I have just given the House. I thought for the fullness of the debate I would point that out. The coalition well and truly welcome the measures in these two bills and we commend them to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  As a former small business owner, it is a great pleasure to speak tonight on the Excise Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011 and the Customs Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011. Both bills are significant in that they deliver on Labor's commitment to reduce compliance costs for excise-liable businesses. Every business person wants to do the right thing in ensuring they meet the commitments required by legislation and regulation. Any mechanism which can reduce compliance costs is a welcome relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a business person you are trying to make money. You want to be marketing yourself, doing the thing you love, the thing you have set the business up to do or you want to be enjoying yourself with your family. Any mechanism to minimise the onerous burden of administration is always welcomed by small business. Small business owners just want to get on with doing business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will allow small businesses to defer the settlement of excise and excise equivalent customs duties from a weekly cycle to a monthly cycle, as the former speaker mentioned. I welcome the comments by the member for Casey that these are welcome and sensible reforms. These bills will clarify administrative arrangements for periodic settlement permissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Excise tax is on certain goods produced in Australia, including alcohol other than wine, tobacco, fuel, crude oil, condensate and lubricants. Where such goods are imported into Australia they are subject to excise equivalent customs duty. Labor is determined to reduce red tape for small businesses and to ensure that they have more flexibility. This is what these bills set out to do. Put simply, the flexibility to choose the particular seven-day cycle that best suits the business's commercial practice will reduce its administrative costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will reduce the business compliance burden and allow small businesses to apply for permission to defer their excise settlement to a monthly reporting cycle, with a further 21 days from the end of the month to remit their tax liability. This will considerably reduce the administration and cash management burden on small businesses. Furthermore, small businesses will be required to lodge only 12 returns per year, as the member for Casey mentioned, as opposed to 52 returns per year under the current arrangements—very welcome relief for small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are all part of Labor's plan to help small businesses and support the economy. Only the Labor government is standing up for tax relief for Australia's small businesses. This is because we recognise the contribution of small business to Australia's economy. It is the backbone of the Australian economy. Small business comprises about 96 per cent of all business and provides 47 per cent of the nation's jobs. We know that small business operators' time is precious—as a former small business owner I know my time was precious—and we want to help them focus on their core business: their livelihood, making a living, doing business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why Labor will help small businesses get the support they need to stay competitive, through reforms such as our clean energy future plan. The carbon pricing scheme will allow us to help small business and build our economy now. We are able to do this because we successfully bullet-proofed the Australian economy and kept it out of recession during the worst economic downturn in three-quarters of a century. Thanks to Labor's efforts the Australian economy's fundamentals have remained strong, with outstanding growth, outstanding low unemployment, record investment and a budget position that is the envy of our peers around the world. That is why we are able to help small businesses now, while those opposite will force small business operators to wait and wait for any tax relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to a clean energy future now will allow us to increase the instant asset write-off from $1,000 to $6,500 for depreciable assets from the 2012-13 income year. This instant asset write-off will improve business cash flow by providing an immediate income tax deduction for the cost of eligible assets. Increasing the amount businesses can write-off immediately to $6,500 will increase cash flow and help small businesses to grow and invest in new equipment so they can keep up to date with the latest technology—again, vitally important to success in small business. I know many small businesses in my electorate of Canberra will benefit from this initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has gone through the risky, frustrating but deeply rewarding process of starting a small business, I know how mindful we, the Gillard government, need to be of continuing to support the private sector in Canberra, which employs well over 50 per cent of the territory's workforce. This means we need to give priority to establishing a framework that aims to minimise red tape, reduce business compliance costs and build on Canberra's many competitive advantages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is introducing other reforms that will allow us to better support small business. The minerals resource rent tax, which is giving all Australians a fairer share of the mining boom, will allow Labor to cut the company tax rate for more than 720,000 small companies in 2012-13—a significant number of small businesses. What this will mean for the many small businesses in electorates like mine is that there will be even more incentive for them to invest in our local communities, invest in technology and invest in a range of other mechanisms. More investment will in turn drive long-term economic growth, and this will mean more jobs and higher wages for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have made it clear that they have no intention of cutting the company tax rate and will make small business wait even longer for any tax relief. When you consider that they cannot even agree on when the budget will return to surplus, that is hardly surprising. They have no plan to return the budget to surplus, unlike the Gillard Labor government, which is committed to returning the budget to surplus in the 2012-13 financial year. This is a key policy priority for the Gillard government, unlike those opposite. They also have no plan to help small business with tax relief and no plan for the general Australian economy. Rather, they want to slash $70 billion from the budget and cut 12,000 public sector jobs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where that $70 billion and those 12,000 jobs will come from is anyone's guess, but I will tell you now: the last time those opposite slashed public sector jobs—30,000 public sector jobs in the mid-nineties under the Howard government—Canberra went spiralling into recession. I know because I was one of the 30,000 cut. Ironically, Canberra went into recession at the same time as the rest of Australia was growing. We lost thousands and thousands of jobs, house prices plummeted, businesses closed down and people moved out of the town. It went through a serious recession when the rest of Australia was growing. This is the future that those opposite want for Canberra—this is the future that they paint for Canberra. They talk about the 12,000 Public Service jobs—they almost brag about it—that they are going to cut, and then they have the $70 billion black hole and now they are looking at cutting about $15 billion of government programs. This is significant money. These are working families in Canberra; this is the future that those opposite want for the people of Canberra. It ain't that pretty. This is what those opposite consider to be good economic management—slashing jobs and taking Canberra back into a recession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to get back onto the issue of helping small businesses. We are doing this in yet another way by simplifying the depreciation of assets, creating a single depreciation pool. This will reduce compliance costs by removing the requirement to calculate depreciation allowances and track assets for depreciation, making asset ownership more attractive than leasing or debt financing. This is good for business and good financial management. Those opposite, on the other hand, have given no commitment to simplify depreciation arrangements, showing that yet again they are not interested in reducing red tape for small business or making life easier for those many thousands of small business people who make such a vital contribution to our nation's economy. Small business must be able to flourish and succeed, and the Gillard government is assisting that process by giving business certainty. That is so important for business. If you are in a business, it is worthwhile making those investments to be successful in the future because you are going to flourish and succeed. We understand the importance of small business, particularly in an electorate like Canberra, as a means of diversifying our economy and creating jobs. Small business provides many vital pathways for people entering the workforce, many for the first time, and increasingly it is offering flexibility for parents, particularly women, re-entering the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have held a number of seminars in my electorate for people who are wanting to start up a small business. I give them the basic tools in terms of  marketing, insurance, how to get an ABN and how to structure their company, if they are going to do that, or how to be a sole trader. The number of women who attend those seminars is phenomenal. I would say probably 75 per cent who attend are women. They all want to have an e-business, a website business or a business that they can operate around their family commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small business is a vital part of the Canberra community. We need to reduce the burden on these small businesses in as many ways as possible, particularly in regard to the administration of small businesses. I know that the member opposite is a very successful businessman. He knows that, when you are in business, you want to be out there doing business, marketing, making new contacts and networking rather than sitting at home doing the paperwork, and any spare time you have you want to spend with your family for some work-life balance. Anyone who is in business knows that it is tough going. It is incredibly rewarding but you do work very hard and you are always grateful for anything that is going to reduce the time you have to spend on administration because essentially it is dead time—you cannot make money and you cannot enjoy the time with your family. That is why I welcome these initiatives and these bills, and I commend the government for introducing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also making it easier for women to return to the workforce through our improved childcare rebate, which gives back to families 50 per cent of their out-of-pocket costs on early childhood education and care. This historic increase in the childcare rebate continues to make a difference for families, who will receive a record $18.1 billion in direct payments from the government over the next four years to help them meet the costs of care. Encouraging more women back into the workforce is a wonderful Labor initiative and it is absolutely vital to everyone I talk to in my electorate. A very large proportion of women in Canberra work and everyone I talk to has particularly welcomed this childcare initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The business seminars I organise are very well attended by women. I am going to be conducting a number of them this year. It is really rewarding meeting these people, having been in business myself. It is a great joy to have your own business and it is really rewarding to talk to people who have a fantastic idea and are on the brink of establishing a business. They want to market it and share it with Canberra and the world through the internet. It is incredibly rewarding to be with these people, particularly women. That is why we need to have in place as many mechanisms as possible to allow women to return to the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will greatly reduce the business compliance burden on small businesses. This is obviously just one of the many ways the government is supporting new businesses and helping existing businesses to succeed. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="230531" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I rise to speak on the Excise Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011and the Customs Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011. Regulation of business activity has always been something of a double-edged sword. The Productivity Commission has noted that, in some instances, regulation has provided social, environmental and even economic benefits. Unfortunately, it also brings significant cost which in many cases far outweighs its intended consequences or benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a business owner, I am far more familiar with the grinding opportunity costs and the financial impost that red tape and compliance legislation can create. I honestly believe that if people had any idea how much time is spent filling out paperwork before they went into business most of them would just simply never bother. No-one opens a cafe because they want to spend their evenings applying for GST credits. Nobody starts a boutique because they are interested in the nitty-gritty of industrial relations. Yet small business people are increasingly expected not only to run their small business profitably but also to have a thorough working knowledge of the type of impossibly dense regulatory detail that would bamboozle a career bureaucrat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I campaigned at the last election on three platforms. Firstly, I gave a commitment that I would fight for more money in the pockets of the mums and dads in my electorate. In fighting for more money for those mums and dads, I oppose new taxes. As you can imagine, in the last parliament I was kept enormously busy. Secondly, I gave a commitment that I would fight for better prices at the farm gate. Whilst we all enjoy the benefits of $1 milk at Coles and Woolworths, it should never be at the expense or the sacrifice of dairy farmers, of which there are many in my electorate. Thirdly, I gave a commitment that I would fight for a reduction in compliance and bureaucratic red tape, which are a burden on my small business sector and impede their profitability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Queensland the cost of red tape compliance has gone up nearly 30 per cent over the last five years alone. Small businesses are now expected to be reading over 90,000 pages of regulation. Queensland has gone from one of the beacons of low cost and low regulation to now being one of the most highly regulated states in the country. In fact, according to the Australian Industry Group, Queensland businesses face the largest direct cost of compliance with a whopping 6.5 per cent of total expenses. Every year, Queensland businesses pay over $7 billion in fees, taxes and other charges. It is nothing short of extraordinary. In light of this unprecedented largesse from the small business sector, and in view of Queensland's current mining boom, the rivers of gold are flowing in our state but the Queensland government has still managed to lose the state's AAA credit rating. But that is Labor's economic credibility for you. Unsurprisingly, a great many small businesses have decided to pull up stumps. Over the past two years I have seen dozens of local businesses in my electorate simply go to the wall. From Jimboomba through to the Lockyer Valley, businesses are doing it tough thanks to low consumer confidence and high compliance costs. Just two streets from my electorate office there are two more empty shopfronts, businesses that before Christmas appeared to be vibrant businesses employing four or five people in each of those outlets. Under a Labor government those jobs are gone; those businesses' doors are shut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, if Premier Bligh manages to cling to power next month, it is only going to get worse for small business because as of the start of this year they have to get their heads around 400 additional pages of new workplace health and safety regulations. Local businesses in my electorate and everywhere else have had a gutful of being made to jump through hoops of red tape just for the privilege of existing, trading and employing people, and trying to make a living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just the Labor Party in Queensland that is slugging businesses with unnecessary compliance costs. The Labor Party in Canberra is doing a pretty good job of it as well. In fact, since 2008 Labor has introduced a whopping 16,173 new regulations. I will repeat that because it is a significant number. Since 2008 Labor has introduced 16,173 new pieces of compliance, and their initial forecast was that as each piece of regulation hit the table they would take one off. Do you know how many have actually come off, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson? I may have to remind you. At the moment it is 79.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills under consideration today, although aimed only at those businesses trading in products eligible for excise or customs duty, are designed to reduce the compliance burden for small businesses, and for that reason they have my support. Under existing excise and customs laws, businesses are required to lodge an entry and pay the applicable excise or customs duty prior to the goods entering the domestic market. However, section 61C of the Excise Act and section 69 of the Customs Act allow for certain small business entities to be granted permission to lodge a return on a weekly basis rather than an individual one. It has been a longstanding practice that the accounting period is weekly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments under discussion allow for the taxpayer to apply for a new weekly period to begin on their preferred day and, additionally, allow for small businesses to apply for permission to defer their excise settlements to a monthly reporting cycle. This alone will reduce lodgement paperwork from 52 returns to 12 per year. It is the view of the coalition that these amendments, however minor, represent a sensible reform to excise and customs duty. Furthermore, they have the support of many industry stakeholders, and therefore I am happy to support them. I conclude by making the point that the coalition's support for this legislation puts an end to the government's hysterical bleating about our so-called relentless negativity. The coalition, in supporting this bill, is attacked by Labor for saying no, no, no. I went to the library and during the life of the 43rd Parliament only 21 per cent of the bills presented to this parliament last year were met with 'no'. The reason they were met with 'no' is that predominantly they were rubbish bills.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                    </a>  Like the member for Wright, I rise to speak in support of the Excise Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011 and the Customs Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011 and thank him for parts of his contribution supporting this piece of legislation. It is a simple but important amendment to help reduce red tape and administration costs for Australian small businesses. As both sides of the chamber would admit, small businesses are the engine room of the economy, particularly jobs growth and innovation. Since the floods in my electorate last year, I have spent a lot of time dealing with small businesses. In fact, I had a gentleman in on Friday, Mr Cheung, who has a furniture store at Rocklea, and he talked about how much he had been impacted by the flood. It went almost to the first floor of his business. His home just down the road was damaged and he has not yet returned. He is living upstairs in his factory. I know that he wants to employ more people as he has a program that employs people with a few disabilities. It would be great to give him as much support as possible. Certainly, businesses in my area were hit hard by the floods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the businesses that many people would know, the Steve Parrish publishing company, was also hard hit and lost an incredible amount of stock. I know their products go all over Australia and all over the world, so they have been hit by both the changing tourism numbers and by floods. One of the local builders, Dean Crocker, told me how hard it was to go back to customers and make sure they had enough confidence to come back to do extensions. I also mention in passing that Dean Crocker's daughter Elizabeth Crocker has just been appointed school captain at West End State School. Congratulations, Elizabeth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that small businesses are important but today small businesses are required to collect excise and customs duties on behalf of the Commonwealth government. Excise duties are imposed on a small range of goods produced in Australia, including spirits, beer, tobacco and tobacco products as well as petroleum based and alternative fuels. Businesses making, dealing, manufacturing or storing these excisable goods require a licence from the Australian Taxation Office. Licence holders are currently required to lodge an excise return every single week. The return records the delivery and movement of goods and the payment of correct duties to the tax office. These bills before the House will enable small businesses to instead pay these duties on a monthly cycle. That will reduce the number of returns to be lodged each year from 52 to 12—less paperwork and less time spent dealing with government red tape. It is necessary government red tape but red tape nevertheless. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses who gain permission to switch to a monthly reporting cycle will be required to lodge their return and pay duty by the 21st day of the following month. Further, all businesses who choose to continue to operate under the seven-day settlement period, which currently runs from Monday to Sunday, will be able to apply for a new weekly period to begin on a day of their choosing—that is, a day that better suits them, their time constraints and the availability of their staff. Thus, businesses will have greater flexibility to match their reporting time frames with the nature of their business. Those small businesses with no duty liabilities may be able to negotiate an even longer reporting cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills also introduce greater flexibility for gaseous fuel distributors who lodge returns on the seven-day cycle. Generally, small businesses lodge a return on or before the sixth business day following the end of each seven-day period. Gaseous fuel businesses, however, require special treatment because excise and excise equivalent customs duty applies—unlike for liquid fuels—only to the transport use of gaseous fuels. Gas distributors need extra time to consolidate sales records to distinguish between fuel supplied for transport and non-transport uses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sensible bills before the chamber build on the Gillard government's proud record of real and practical support for Australian small businesses. We are helping to bolster business, support the economy and protect and create jobs—particularly protect jobs. We are doing this by shredding red tape, reducing compliance costs and making taxes fairer for all Australian businesses. As I said, they are the engine room of jobs and innovation. I remind all Australians of the innovative measures of the Labor governments of the 42nd and 43rd parliaments. One example is the introduction, following the GFC, of the 50 per cent tax break for eligible assets. I have had so many small businesses thank me for that initiative. Another example is the $10 million used to help small businesses go online so that they can increase their productivity. That fits in with the greater productivity agenda behind our NBN initiative—something that occasionally people rail against but something that is essential if you look at how much the world has changed. So many things these days are being done online—booking travel, buying music, going on a holiday or even buying groceries. That is where the productivity initiatives will come from—from having things like the NBN. I look forward to small businesses taking that opportunity to go online. It will mean they can compete with the rest of the world. Another Labor government initiative was the change to PAYG instalments to ensure better cash flow. All of these measures together help to support our hardworking small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses are looking forward to the cut in company taxes from 30 per cent down to 29 per cent. That will benefit 2½ million companies, many of which are small businesses—not the small businesses of battlers like Twiggy, Gina and Clive; these are fair dinkum small businesses who will appreciate the cut. How it can be argued with a straight face that we need to protect Gina, Clive and Twiggy rather than 2½ million small businesses, I do not understand. I am yet to hear a logical argument from those opposite but I look forward to it and to the logical argument behind the member for Warringah's idea of whacking a 1.7 per cent tax on all those businesses. It is quite incredible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is another important step along the way to supporting jobs, supporting the economy and making sure that Australia has a bright future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="1K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BILLSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  The Excise Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011 and the Customs Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011 represent a worthwhile step by this government in reducing red tape and compliance burdens, particularly on small business. I make that positive remark to open the batting because so rare are the opportunities to say that about something tangible which could be helpful to small business. But this actually is one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This positive measure was originally proposed by the Howard government. I have before me a press release dated 8 May 2007 from the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Peter Dutton, announcing this very measure. Sadly, the parliament was prorogued before the measure was legislated. For many small businesses, this began the 'welcome to your nightmare' with the election of the Rudd and Gillard governments. This measure had its genesis in the Howard government years. It was accurately identified by then Minister Dutton as a measure building on the Howard government's track record of reducing red tape for small businesses. I think we are onto our third or fourth Labor Assistant Treasurer with responsibility for this area and the Gillard government is introducing the measure, which actually commenced in 2007. You do not want to rush these things! Obviously there are a range of interesting reasons it has taken so long, but it is actually a positive measure. It was recognised by the first Assistant Treasurer in the Labor government as being something that was truncated by the proroguing of parliament. Then Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen made that point on 13 May 2008.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a nutshell, these bills facilitate a more orderly reporting cycle for small business. Rather than a weekly requirement on small businesses to report on and pay excise—a tax on certain goods produced in Australia or imported relating to alcohol, tobacco, fuel, crude oil and lubricants—there will now be a monthly reporting cycle with monthly settlement of excise obligations. This is a good thing. This should see a reduction in the lodgement of paperwork from 52 returns a year to 12, a more orderly process for alignment of reporting with normal business reporting cycles and more orderly arrangements for remitting any tax liability that arises. That is a good thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat here, however, and listened carefully to the government speakers talking about their proud record for small business and wondered whether I was in a parallel universe. Some of the remarks were just dripping with hypocrisy, given the comparison between what has actually been done by this government against the claims being made by its members. I will do the House a favour by updating the current regulations-in, regulations-out record of this Gillard-Rudd government since its promise of one in, one out. You might recall I was quite critical and referred to that great philosopher Maxwell Smart in suggesting the government had missed by 'that much' in achieving its policy commitment. I think up to the election the record was about one out for every 220 in. In fairness, and I am a reasonable man by most people's evaluations, that has improved. As of the end of November in the last calendar year, that had changed from one regulation out for 220 in to one regulation out for every 204 in. That is an improvement. I will give the aggregate result since the election of Labor according to the common law record, which captures all the movements in legislative instruments, including select legislative instruments, statutory rules and regulations. The regulations-in record is 16,173 since the election of Labor. That is 16,173 new regulations in—and the regulations-out figure over that period is 79. So there is certainly scope to achieve red-tape reduction, and it is pleasing that the government is picking up on a Howard government initiative to actually do something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they were very serious about it, though, they would embrace the commitments in the positive agenda of the coalition. I am not just saying they are positive because I crafted them, or because everyone in the small business community says they are positive—even some learned commentators not known for loose bouts of praise. No, I am actually drawing from the assessment of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. For those who are listening, when there is an election and prospects of a change of government the Prime Minister's department produces a blue book. This blue book contains the knowledge being transferred to the incoming government and provides an overview on policy commitments and what steps the Public Service will take to implement those election commitments. Interestingly, the Prime Minister's own department concluded that the small business microeconomic reform agenda, encapsulated in our real plan for small business, was a very positive thing for small business. It said it could provide an important boost to productivity as well. That is a very strong endorsement. It leaves you wondering. We dished up more than a dozen specific measures, including tax cuts, proper reward for risk-taking in small business, access to finance and help with paid parental leave. These were grotesquely misrepresented by those opposite as something that will not involve small business in being the pay clerk but will actually be financed not by an increase in tax but by a deferral of a tax reduction for the most profitable companies in the land. So that is the idea compared with the government's one. There were other measures in this plan about unfair-contract protection being extended to small business, protecting those people who are self-employed, and independent contractors, by stopping this coordinated attack on that very important group of small business people and also the attack on the personal services income laws. The plan is about actually giving small businesses a chance to have access to Commonwealth contracts and then pay their bills on time. I was happy to reveal the half billion dollars of delayed payments to small business just in recent weeks. Also there was the establishment of a dedicated advocate for the small business community who would be working alongside a cabinet-level minister—a small business and family enterprise ombudsman. It is about giving small business a say at some of the major economic agencies and forums, such as the board of taxation, getting our competition laws to give small business half a chance in a competitive economy and getting the government off the back of small business through reductions in red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have gone further as we have outlined a number of very specific changes. There is actually one that should have been before the parliament today, another practical coalition initiative to have small business relieved of the unwanted and unwarranted burden of being the pay clerk for the government's paid parental leave scheme. For reasons that are best known to the union movement, the government is insistent on having all employers do the government's work for it and be the pay clerk for paid parental leave payments. It has been able to offer no justification whatsoever for that. However, I was given a secret union document revealing that if that machinery were not enforced upon all employers it might impede the unions' agenda to force up paid parental leave payments from employers to eligible employees as part of a coordinated industrial campaign. So this is one of these little behind-the-scenes whispering campaigns that we have learnt so much about with the Labor Party—just witness the Australia Day matter—and which goes on and substitutes for good leadership and good governance in this country. Here is a dirty deal that has been done to fit up all employers, big and small, with the machinery to pay the government's paid parental leave arrangements solely so the unions can then come along and force employers to top up the deficient scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got amendments before the House that should have been debated today and that actually say that the employer should only do that where they agree to do it and where the eligible employee agrees. That is pretty straightforward. It is a matter of choice. I recall the government rolled out Sony as its example when it attacked my proposal last time. They are not a small company. Their pay office staff is probably five times the size of your average entire small business, but that is the example that the government brought out. Sony said, 'We're happy to pay it because we'll just tack it on to the end of our own scheme.' Now that is great if they are in a position to do that, and what the coalition says is, 'Knock yourself out if you want to be that pay clerk.' But for those people who are time poor now, why is this being imposed upon them? We looked to the new small business minister, Senator Arbib, known to be a powerbroker and known to roar in some circles of the Labor Party. But there was not a squeak from Senator Arbib when he had his first test and a chance to do something practical and substantial for the small business community to tackle red tape. No, instead he has come out double-teaming with Minister Macklin to give me a spray, not addressing the issues and targeting the practical solutions that we are providing for small business but holding a personal attack on me.</span>

                    </a>  You are very kind and that is very reasonable given the ranging comments that came from other members on the government side in this place. So, talking about a practical small business initiative, we then go and look at an interview that the small business minister had with <span style="font-style:italic;">SmartCompany</span>. The question is asked whether it would be easier if he were in cabinet and he says that no, that does not matter and that what you need is a minister who can bust down the door of cabinet when there is something that the small business community needs to have said. Well, he has gone from door buster to feather duster. He has been pushed over by a soft breeze. Then, after being a feather duster he comes out with pure bluster. That is the transformation—no help and no assistance, just a gratuitous go at me. He has ignored the substantive issue of concern to the small business community. He is protecting his own reputation and ignoring the needs of small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure today, which had its genesis in the Howard government, now comes before this parliament some four years later. Hopefully it will be a step that will improve the record of one out for every 204 in. Hopefully it will see 16,173 regulations out for 79 in. Perhaps this might be a better start for the government this year. Heaven knows, their best year since they were elected was their first year, where there were 33 instruments repealing legislation compared with just under 4,700 new ones. That is the high-water mark they have to compete with. In the meantime, this bill is a good measure and that is why the coalition is supporting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor is fair dinkum there is another measure that should have been debated here today. It was listed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> last week but has been quite mysteriously pulled. It was a practical measure to help small business by giving them the option not to do the pay clerk role of the government if they are not in a position to do so or not inclined to do so. It is a real test for members in this place, particularly some of the Labor members talking about all the good things the government is doing for small business, to turn their minds to whether they want to make that practical step. We wonder when that bill will come back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said he would knock down the cabinet doors if small business views were not being taken into consideration. That was his quote. He has managed not to do that. He has managed to be blown over and brushed around like a feather duster, and then he comes back with pure bluster. What about dealing with the substantive issue. That is what this bill before the parliament seeks to do, but this is a very modest step. I hope it is a habit that is catching. It is nice to see a very modest piece of red tape reduction and regulatory relief for small business, albeit a carbon copy of what the Howard government brought forward under, at the time, Minister Dutton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can pick up the plan the small business community wants implemented. They do not have to be shy about it. They can just say that they are outsourcing policy development on small business to the coalition. They could pick up the billion-dollar commitment to reduce the cost and burden of red tape that is being led by my friend and colleague Arthur Sinodinos. There are so many good things that could be done if only the government swallowed its pride and recognised that it had no feel whatsoever for small business. We need to do this because confidence amongst the small business community is very low, and many small businesses I talk to are profoundly disturbed about their economic prospects for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government boasts about the conditions of the economy, the statistics tell a remarkable and frighteningly different story. Did you know that the number of small businesses—and this is recognising that small business is the engine room of the economy—employing between one and 19 people has declined over the life of this government? There are now some 14,500 fewer small businesses employing between one and 19 people, compared to what was the case before the Rudd and Gillard governments were elected. There are some 300,000 fewer people with jobs in the private sector in the small business community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are worrying concerns about the punishing impact of the carbon tax and what it will do for a sector that is uncompensated and seemingly not of the slightest interest to the government, namely, the small business community. They will cop the harshest hit of this compounding carbon tax right through the supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you hear government members talk about the tax relief being given to small business. Let us just recap on where that is. In the last election the coalition was offering more relief for small businesses structured as companies. It is patently wrong when the Treasurer says 2.7 million small businesses will get relief from company tax reductions, because only a third of small businesses are actually companies and fewer still are profitable and paying company tax. Moreover, in the mining tax there is a measure to repeal the entrepreneurs tax offset. That will increase the tax paid by the 400,000 smallest businesses in this country, some of which will see their income tax double as a consequence of the mining tax. So, when you hear the Labor members talking about all the things they are doing for small business, all I can say is that some of those remarks are dripping with hypocrisy. The actual record is disturbing. I am here to work with the small business community to get going and get the support they provided happening again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  I rise to speak on the Excise Amendment (Reducing Business Compliance Burden) Bill 2011 to express my support for its measures. We on this side of the House understand two things in relation to small business. The first is that small business is indeed the backbone of our economy. It employs millions of people. There are tens of thousands of small businesses across this country and they create enormously valuable products that consumers enjoy. They provide the lifeblood for hundreds of thousands of families. In my electorate alone there are over 10,000 small businesses employing many more people than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing we understand about small business is that red tape is the bane of them. We know that for small business people less red tape and less paperwork means higher profits, boosted sales and more time with families. We also know that red tape and extra paperwork stifles business activity, stifles entrepreneurship and stifles innovation. Indeed, in many cases it prevents new businesses from starting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is our starting point: one, that small business is the lifeblood of our economy and we should be supporting it, and, two, that red tape is the bane of small business and we therefore should be trying to minimise it as much as possible. In this case, we give the bill before us a tick because it does more to reduce red tape. The bill does this in a very modest way, as the member for Dunkley pointed out, but nevertheless it is an important way because it reduces some red tape in relation to excise duties. It simplifies the reporting arrangements so that, at the very least, businesses that have to pay excise can report on a weekly basis beginning on the seven-day cycle that makes sense for them so that they can align their reporting cycle with other reporting mechanisms they have to submit. On top of that, it means that some small businesses can request to report on a monthly basis rather than on a weekly basis. So potentially this has the chance of reducing red tape by three-quarters, if they are reporting monthly rather than weekly. Again, it is a good, practical measure to support those small businesses which have to pay the excise duties. We commend the government for introducing this bill. It is a good bill and it will make a difference to those small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in relation to small business, that is where my commendation for the government unfortunately ends, because in many other areas it is not actually making things easier for small business but, rather, is making things more difficult. I will point out, first of all, some simple facts in relation to regulation. We should have collectively a goal to reduce red tape for small business, to reduce red tape and regulations overall. I was in part surprised at the government's commitment—which at least was going along these lines—not to increase red tape. It made a commitment that, for every new regulation, it would remove one. That was its solemn promise to the people and to the small businesses of Australia: for every regulation it introduced, it would remove one. Okay, that does not reduce red tape overall, but at least it keeps it stationary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what has happened since Labor has been in government? It has not been one in for every one removed, not even two in for every one removed. Rather, in the time of this government, we have had 12,835 pieces of new red tape—new regulations—introduced, and how many have we had removed? Fifty-eight. So 12,835 in and 58 out. That translates to one out for every 220 in. To be fair, the member for Dunkley did just point out that the government has improved in this area. It is no longer one out for every 220 in; it is now one out for only 204 in. So it is a substantial improvement. Well done! But we still have a long way to go. Again, I commend the government for this bill. It is a good measure to remove red tape in this area, but there is still a long, long, long way to go for this government if it is really serious about reducing red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will point out some other measures which are making it tougher for small business. It is a climate, as you would realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, in which small businesses are doing it particularly tough. All of us on this side of the chamber would appreciate that just from speaking to the small businesses in our own electorates. Retailers are doing it particularly tough. There is barely a single retailer who is doing well at present. Manufacturing, as we know from reading the papers on a daily basis, is laying off jobs. The construction industry is slowing down. There are shops which are now not open which had been open for many, many years. We are only too aware of the difficulties which small businesses are facing. In that climate, the last thing that we should be doing is adding additional obstacles for small business. But, when you go through some of the measures which the government has put in place, even over the last 12 months, you see that they only make the job of small businesses tougher. I will point out a few of those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have talked at length about some of the employment laws which have been introduced in the Fair Work Act in this place. Go-away money for small businesses has returned, as many people are telling us. Union access has again increased dramatically, above and beyond what would ordinarily be considered reasonable. We hear of circumstances where schoolkids who want to work for a couple of hours after school in the local small business have been prevented from doing so by ridiculous laws which have been introduced which prevent that reasonable thing from happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can look at some of the tax measures that the government has introduced. I note particularly the entrepreneurs tax offset, which has been abolished as part of the mining tax package. It was just slipped in very quietly in the mining tax package—no fanfare—but it affects tens of thousands of people across this country. Small contractors who are earning less than $75,000 a year will now pay up to $800 more tax because of the abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see the additional pressure on interest rates which this government is putting onto small business because of the enormous budget deficits which the government is running. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out just after question time today, the government has clocked up the four largest budget deficits in Australia's political history in the last four years alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The granddaddy of them all is the carbon tax, which unfortunately is due for implementation come 1 July this year. In the context of everything else which is going on in small business, the carbon tax is going to hit them particularly hard, because there is barely a small business which does not use electricity as one of the large inputs to its business. We know, from the government's own figures, that electricity prices will increase by 10 per cent in the first year alone, although the electricity sector says it is likely to be 20 per cent. That is on top of the ordinary electricity increases. That is just the starting point, when the tax starts at $23 per tonne. Again on the government's own figures, that tax is forecast to increase to $29 within a few years and then to just keep going up and up and up and up. Of course, those costs then flow on to every single other product which consumers have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me summarise by reiterating my support for this bill. I commend the government for introducing it. It is one of the few measures which the government has introduced which do the right thing by small business and reduce the regulatory burden for them. But I ask the government to go further than this and to look at some of the measures which the coalition has put forward and which the member for Dunkley outlined earlier. Look at those, examine them and feel free to adopt them, because they are good measures and they would reduce the regulatory compliance burden for small business, they would reduce tax for small business and they would enable small businesses to grow and flourish.</span>

These bills deliver on this government's commitment to reduce business compliance costs for businesses dealing with goods liable for excise and excise equivalent customs duty. These bills amend the Excise Act 1901 and the Customs Act 1901 to codify administrative arrangements relating to periodic settlement permissions in relation to excise and customs duty. The amendments establish a flexible seven-day permission cycle for the giving of returns and the payment of excise and excise equivalent customs duty. When the seven-day permission is for gaseous fuels, the permission holder may give their return and pay duty up to six business days following the end of the seven-day period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, small business entities, prescribed persons and producers of prescribed goods will be able to apply for a permission to defer their customs duty settlement to a monthly reporting cycle.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="885" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TURNBULL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:18</span>):  The three bills before the House all relate to the universal service obligation. The USO is the government imposed requirement that central communications services, including standard telephones services in homes and business and public payphones, be accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis—that is, that they can obtained on reasonable terms at an affordable price everywhere in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills also affect two other communications services which are intimately related to the USO but not formally part of it. They are the provision of the triple 0 emergency call service across the nation and the national relay service, or NRS, which delivers voice equivalent services to Australians who are deaf or who have a speech or hearing impediment by translating voice to text or text to voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very existence of the USO underlies the importance of telecommunications services in our economy and our society. It is difficult to imagine a world without ubiquitous access to the ability to speak to and listen to someone in another place in real time. It is a miracle of technology, but it is central to our economy and to the way most of us live our daily lives and interact with one another. So ensuring that people who in an entirely unsubsidised and unfettered market might not receive this access on the same terms as most of us—people in remote areas of the country where providing basic services is uneconomic or people with disabilities who cannot use the standard types of services offered—can in fact receive affordable access is an absolutely legitimate and, indeed, critical function of government and has been for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, Telstra has responsibility for delivering most of the USO, reflecting its status as the former monopoly public telecommunications carrier. Telstra is required by regulation to provide standard telephone services and public payphones on an equitable basis. In return, it receives most of the proceeds of two industry-wide levies that apply to it and to other licensed carriers. The levy directly related to the USO raises about $145 million a year. A separate levy related to the National Relay Service raises about $15 million a year against annual costs of about $17 million to provide the NRS under the current contract with a private sector provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telstra has argued for more than a decade that the net payments it receives from the USO levy—that is to say, the net payments it receives from the levy less the payments it contributes as a carrier to the levy—do not cover its own net costs in providing the USO. This has been a contentious matter in the telecommunications industry for years and one only has to look at the submission from Optus to the Senate committee that is considering this bill to see how trenchantly and indeed cogently Telstra's competitors argue that it really should be providing this service for no consideration at all—or very little consideration. In any event, this contentious issue depends on whether the relevant costs are calculated for a new provider of the USO having to start from scratch or an existing carrier with a network whose original costs have long since been recovered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Paul Paterson of Castalia, the independent expert the government commissioned earlier this year to consider this question, largely agreed with Telstra, concluding that the company's net costs in providing the USO aggregated with the cost of the NRS and public payphones were in the order of between $250 million and $300 million. That was the conclusion of the Castalia report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The broader context that is important to note here is that the current arrangements were designed at a time when Telstra was the vertically integrated operator of the only telecommunications network in Australia. As we all appreciate, that is no longer the case in today's more open and competitive telecommunications market. In the ownership of the core network, this has not been the case for some years. Of course, this government, with its profligate, irresponsible, unanalysed $50 billion NBN, is trying to make a key part of the market less open and entirely uncompetitive—that is, the local access network, the so-called last mile of connections between residences or business premises and local exchanges. This is one of the cases where Australia is unique in the world, leading the world in creating government monopolies in telecommunications. Everywhere else, governments are trying to promote facilities based on competition and promote private sector investment in telecommunications infrastructure, but not in Australia. The government is creating a massive government owned monopoly. But still, as the NBN is rolled out prior to the next election, it means there is another part of the network where Telstra will no longer be the sole player. In fact, Telstra has agreed to gradually decommission its legacy copper customer access network and its hybrid fibre coax network and migrate customers to the NBN as the latter is rolled out. So the need to change the way the USO is currently provided is, in large part, a response to the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even without the NBN, there is merit in shifting the basis of the USO from a regulatory requirement imposed on Telstra, where its true cost is opaque and only partly funded by transfers, to a more transparent contractual arrangement where a chosen tenderer will provide the service at an agreed price funded in full from direct transfers. Such a shift would be theoretically appropriate given the changing structure of the industry and would be entirely consistent with the economic values of our party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, after all, in numerous areas of public policy over the past 20 or 30 years embedded cross subsidies or intrusive regulations designed to achieve public interest outcomes have been replaced by more transparent and more honest contractual arrangements where the true cost of achieving a policy objective is clearer and there is competition to deliver it. We in the coalition have vigorously criticised Labor's NBN for its decision to equalise wholesale broadband prices in the cities and in the bush via an embedded and opaque cross-subsidy rather than a transparent transfer. We are absolutely agreed that there should be an equivalence in the cost of accessing broadband across Australia, but we do not believe that that equivalence should be at the cost of stamping out competition right around the nation and certainly should not be at the cost of stamping out competition in those areas in the cities where competition is very feasible and would occur were it not for the anti-competitive policies and practices of the NBN and this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our public policy principles, it would be inconsistent to criticise measures that make the true cost of the USO clearer and ensure that they are fully funded. Likewise, we have no objection to replacing two separate industry levies for the USO and the NRS, the national relay service, with a single levy. Greater simplicity and less administrative overhead are always useful guiding principles when raising revenue. Alas, as we have come to expect with this Labor government, attempts to rationalise public policy or adhere to sensible economic principles are almost always botched by inept execution and failures to observe due process by this government. And so it is with these bills, where we have several very serious concerns. We question the decision to create an entirely new bureaucracy, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, TUSMA, to assume responsibility for the USO where there is an existing regulator, ACMA, with the same responsibilities. Yet again, this is the case of this government unthinkingly expanding the number of quangos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have indicated on many occasions, we are dubious about Labor's determination to impose the one-size-fits-all NBN on every part of the country without regard for either cost or fitness for purpose. In the case of the USO, this manifests itself as the absence of any independent review mechanism to ensure basic services delivered over this costly new government controlled monopoly are at least comparable in price and quality to those services delivered on the existing network. Most of all, we are concerned that the good public policy of moving to a direct and transparent subsidy for the USO and putting it out to tender has been sullied, avoided and eliminated by the incredibly poor public policy of entering into a pre-emptive 20-year contract where Telstra will continue to provide the USO as retailer of last resort. Frankly, I think we can all understand that this is, in truth, simply part of the very generous consideration required to gain Telstra's consent to the deal it agreed with the NBN Co. last June. On the issue of bureaucracy, I note that TUSMA is just the latest quango from a government that has undeniably achieved world's best practice in the creation of quangos. It will have annual administrative overheads of $5 million. ACMA already has around 40 staff with direct responsibility for the USO and it will be ACMA that will continue to collect the industry levy that pays for the services which TUSMA will oversee under the proposed regime. Therefore, the first amendment, which my colleague the member for Cowper will move, will require that the new administrative overheads of TUSMA be offset by a commensurate reduction in the existing administrative overheads of ACMA. As the bill is set out, TUSMA will have the responsibility to enter into service contracts or provide grants to ensure delivery of the USO in accordance with standards and benchmarks set by the communications minister and this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Starting from 2014-15 the TUSMA bills will allow the communications minister progressively to release Telstra from its existing regulatory USO responsibilities as satisfactory contractual agreements replace it in some areas. In areas where the NBN has been deployed, Telstra will become the retail provider of last resort, as opposed to the network provider. All contracts, service agreements and grants to implement the USO will be managed by TUSMA. TUSMA will also be responsible for ensuring voice-only customers are transitioned smoothly onto the NBN. These arrangements are all very well should the NBN continue in one form or another; but the government's one-size-fits-all approach to fixed-line communications, where any alternative infrastructures are to be wiped out either by contract or by statute, and the as yet untested nature of the NBN itself, leads us to an additional and second amendment—which the member for Cowper will also move—which provides for an independent review of whether USO services provided over the NBN are equivalent to those that exist today. Before the existing USO obligations on Telstra can be relaxed, the review would have to report back confirming that new services using the NBN are equivalent in all key respects to existing services—equivalent in price, equivalent in quality, equivalent in availability and equivalent in convenience. This is a very good mechanism for offering a further level of protection to rural and regional telecommunications users and therefore should be something our friends the regional Independents should consider very carefully indeed. We would encourage them to support this amendment because the beneficiaries of the amendment would be their constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review would be required to be conducted by someone with expertise in rural and regional communications, recognising the importance of service quality for the largest group of consumers who depend on the USO arrangements. The amendment specifies the review cannot be carried out until there are at least 10,000 voice-only lines in operation on the NBN, a figure which surely must be achieved quite soon, given that the NBN Co.'s 2011-2013 corporate plan confidently states there will be 137,000 customers using the NBN fibre network by June, five months from now. Given that around one-third of fixed line customers at the moment are voice only, reaching this benchmark should present no impediment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our third major area of concern is that, having made the decision to move to deliver the USO and the NRS by contractual arrangement rather than by regulation, the government has jumped into a 20-year contract with Telstra without a proper competitive tender, or any other recognisable element of due process, at a rate of $290 million a year. This contract covers the USO standard telephone service, the USO payphones and the emergency call service. In reality, as we all know, this deal, which has a value to Telstra of around three-quarters of a billion dollars in 2010 terms, is simply part of the consideration for the deal with NBN Co. finalised in June and currently under consideration by the ACCC. That deal is no doubt very favourable for Telstra, which will collect something like $50 billion over the next 35 years. But it is not as attractive for taxpayers and broadband consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the sweep of that complex and costly deal, providing Telstra with a long-term contract to deliver the USO, at an annual value in about the middle of the range suggested by the independent experts' report, is far from the most questionable element. In reality, it is not clear whether any other provider could have efficiently delivered the USO, given the government's commitment to continue to use fixed lines rather than explore other technical possibilities. Nonetheless, there has once again been a complete absence of due process. The NBN was undertaken without any cost-benefit analysis, notwithstanding the government's pledge prior to coming into office that there would be no major infrastructure projects funded by the Commonwealth without a cost-benefit analysis. Just as they failed to do that important piece of homework before they undertook the NBN, here they have created some legislation which allows for a transparent contractual process for delivering this important service but then have completely ignored it and entered into a deal where there is an obvious lack of competitive neutrality. The arrangement with Telstra has been negotiated at the same time as, and as a subset of, a much larger multibillion dollar deal, so there can be no confidence that the price that has been concluded is one that would have arisen from a competitive process. Why couldn't the government have undertaken a transparent, competitive tender? They seem to be incapable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see that my colleague the member for Chifley on the other side of the House is paying close attention to this. He may well say that a competitive tender would have resulted in the same outcome. It may well have done so—who knows?—in which case, there would be some genuine public confidence in it. This is where the government, time after time, wounds itself by failing to undertake basic due process. It does not take much more time, but it certainly results in an outcome that has integrity, that is transparent and that people can then have confidence in. While Telstra may in all probability be the only realistic provider of this service, in the absence of a tender we will never know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this legislation is yet another example of what is a defensible set of policy ideas bungled, compromised and debased in the execution—something at which this government has shown itself to be a master. Again and again its failures of due process undermine whatever administrative or policy reform objectives it has. We in the coalition support many of the principles embodied in these bills, as I have described. But we have grave reservations about their translation from principle to practice. The failure of due process once again has debased the objectives of policy.</span>

                    <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:38</span>):  It is my intention to deal with some of the comments made by the opposition spokesperson on communication later in my contribution. I want to deal with some of the points that he raised because they should not be left unanswered. He suggested that certain things have not been done. A cursory reading of the explanatory memorandum and of the legislation shows that they have. There will be a great degree of transparency and accountability in the way that TUSMA manages its affairs and the grants in relation to the universal service obligation. I will deal with that in the latter part of my contribution to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have, as have others on the government side, spoken at length about a number of things in relation to the provision of broadband services in the country. Firstly, I have spoken about how we need a faster and more reliable broadband service. Wherever I go in my electorate to talk about this, people are clamouring to get access to the NBN. I have spoken up for people in certain suburbs within the electorate of Chifley who have experienced major problems in getting some form of internet access over the last decade. They have been let down by a number of things. Some of those things include the types of regulatory arrangements that have been in place and the war that went on between Telstra and the former government over the provision of broadband services. Another was the former government's inability on 19 separate occasions to get it right. They tried 19 times to get a broadband plan in place. Clearly, they saw the need for something to be done. Yet they come into this place now saying that we need to undertake a cost-benefit analysis. This after 19 failed attempts to deal with the huge demand for the high-speed and reliable broadband that is being enjoyed by many other nations in our region, where we do not even rate in terms of the quality or speed of our service. I have spoken at length on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The investment that this government is making in the National Broadband Network will not only meet the demand for faster and more reliable services but provide fibre-to-the-premise services to about 93 per cent of the country. The remainder will be provided service through either satellite or wireless. Coverage is an important element of the NBN, with many more Australians expected to enjoy the type of broadband speeds required to run small businesses these days. I talk with businesses in the electorate of Chifley, which I represent. Real estate agents, for example, talk about the need for agencies in a network to have connections with comparable speeds, because if they do not then the agency with the slowest speed dominates their internal network. Small business needs it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schools need it. This struck me when I visited William Dean Public School in Dean Park. They have entire computer rooms for primary school students. You can imagine the next generation becoming conversant with technology, adopting it in their daily lives, as many of us do in this place. And I note that the member for Paterson on the other side of the House using his iPad, adopting—as many of us have—technology that helps us become more efficient and productive. Young people who adopt technology will require faster speeds and better reliability. They want to see that. So small businesses and schools want this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of serving on the House of Representatives Infrastructure and Communications Committee. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadening the debate </span>report talked about the improvements in health that will come about due to having access to faster broadband. Innovative new approaches will particularly benefit remote parts of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For quite some time, Australians have, as part of their communications services, been guaranteed universal service obligations. They have enjoyed certain protections to ensure that all people in Australia, no matter where they live or conduct business, have reasonable access on an equitable basis to standard telephone services and payphones. This has in more recent times been secured through the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Services Standards) Act 1999. Under the act, Telstra is the primary universal service provider, responsible for fulfilling the universal service obligation, referred to as the USO, throughout the whole of Australia. Telstra is obliged to have a policy statement and a marketing plan approved by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The policy statement and marketing plan outline how Telstra intends to fulfil its obligations as the universal service provider, including its obligations to people with a disability, people with special needs and eligible priority customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The act also requires that losses that result from supplying loss-making services in the course of fulfilling the USO are to be shared among carriers. However, as alluded to earlier in my contribution, we are obviously on the threshold of major transformation within the sector on a number of grounds. Obviously, as technology changes we see changing consumer use. People were once dependent on landlines. Landline use in Australia is now declining and it is obvious why that is the case. People are taking up mobile phones. Instead of having landlines, they rely on mobile phones or on internet access to help drive the VoIP services. Certainly what was useful to read was the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's submission in December 2001 to the Senate inquiry into the legislative reform package. TIO, the independent watchdog, noted that the use of landline services in Australia has declined over recent years as consumers increasingly take up mobile, broadband and convergent technologies. They see that reflected when new complaints regarding landline services received by the TIO have decreased since 2008-09 with a stable number of new complaints received over 2009-10 and 2010-11. And you see a lot of this reflected too whenever Telstra brings out its financial statements of performance. They show how landline use is declining and obviously mobile and broadband use is increasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you see the change in consumer use and you see that we are moving from copper to fibre. Also a dominant, vertically integrated player in the form of Telstra, under the reforms passed by this place and by the Senate, will eventually be structurally separated and the wholesale network will change as a result of the rollout of fibre to replace copper. That will mean that people will get access to new services. So the old USO which was copper based and provided by a dominant, vertically integrated player will over time be substituted by new services. As I mentioned earlier, with people using other ways to communicate—VoIP services, Skype—technology and industry change is requiring us to look differently at the USO and the way it is delivered. As a result, we have needed to bring in new bills to ensure continuity of the safeguards enjoyed by people for many years as we transition to the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 23 June last year the government, along with Telstra, announced that these types of arrangements would be put in place to ensure, among other things, that Australians would have reasonable access to a standard telephone service and that payphones would be reasonably accessible to all Australians. There will be the ongoing delivery of the Emergency Call Service by Telstra—that is, calls to 000 and 112—the ongoing delivery of the National Relay Service and the appropriate safety net arrangements being in place to assist the migration of voice-only customers to an NBN fibre service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting that not everyone will want to get onto the internet using the NBN.  Some people will just want to have telephone access in their home. We need to ensure that the NBN can provide that. As Telstra's customer access network, the CAN, is decommissioned there will be a safety net in place to look after those people and technological solutions will be developed to support continuity of other public interest services such as public alarm systems and traffic lights. Obviously research will support working out the best way to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of all that, as announced last year, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency will be set up and this bill establishes the necessary framework to create TUSMA. Over time we will see the focus shift from services normally provided by Telstra—being the dominant player—ultimately being oversighted by TUSMA. They will be primarily responsible for entering into contracts or grants to deliver USO services, the 000 Emergency Call Service and the National Relay Service and will also support the continuing supply of services during transition to NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 will allow the minister to permit USO regulatory obligations to be progressively lifted from Telstra, subject to Telstra meeting a number of preconditions. The progressive lifting of the USO will be linked to the rollout of the NBN and the structural separation of Telstra. The reform bill will phase out the existing USO and NRS levy arrangements and give ACMA the power to administer and enforce a new consolidated industry levy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill will impose a levy on relevant industry participants to contribute to the cost of TUSMA not otherwise funded by government and will effectively replace the current levies for the USO and NRS. And, being established as a statutory agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act, it will have extensive reporting obligations. It will also be required to maintain a public register of grants and contracts. Again, the member for Wentworth seemed to suggest that these types of arrangements would not be in place but, as I stressed earlier, the explanatory memorandum sets out quite clearly that it will be required to implement and effectively administer telecommunications service agreements and grants and that there will be a degree of accountability to the parliament over these issues. They will continue to have some form of reporting back to the parliament and there will be oversight provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills provide certainty, transparency and accountability, maintaining consumer safeguards as we transition. I am confident the legislation achieves the desired outcomes, providing continuity of safeguards under the USO. That is a view supported in the submission by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to the Senate committee I referred to earlier where they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The USO legislative reform package seeks to achieve continuity of key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to NBN. To this end, the policy objectives for the contracts or grants TUSMA will administer, set out in clause 11 of the Bill appear to largely reflect the objective.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also had the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, the peak body representing consumers on communication issues, support the thrust of the objectives of the bills, stating that they do support the transition from universal service being the sole responsibility of Telstra to a universal service model open to new players.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also other community comment on this matter. The internet has transformed the way that the public can engage in this and that is a good thing. Someone who corresponds with me via Twitter, Michael Wyres, has reviewed the TUSMA arrangements and says there is a fear that, with the shutdown of the Telstra copper network, universal service obligations will disappear. He says: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Frankly, that was never going to happen—any government would be committing suicide by taking that protection away. The TA—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the TUSMA agreement—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">also ensures that in non-NBN fibre areas, the existing copper network would be maintained to allow for the continuation of an STS to people in those areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are people who are clearly analysing what is being put forward and who recognise protections will be in place but, importantly, who are reflecting on the fact that as telecommunications technology evolves we need to move with it and we need to ensure regulatory arrangements keep up with the times.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="230531" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011. The universal service obligation is a vital aspect of Australia's telecommunications system. Every Australian, regardless of where they live, needs and deserves access to basic telephone services at a reasonable price. The USO supposedly guarantees that these services will always be available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Primarily, the USO is designed for residents in regional and remote Australia. My electorate of Wright is in the western hinterland of the Gold Coast and travels through to the top of the Toowoomba Range. It is predominantly a horticultural and agricultural precinct and definitely falls into the regional, and in parts remote, area of Australia. For people in regional and remote Australia, access to basic phone services is vital because other communication options are frequently either not affordable or completely unavailable. Obviously, in regional and remote parts of the country the provision of basic phone services, including payphones, is not economically viable so some sort of subsidy is necessary to ensure they are made available. Payphones are particularly important in remote towns where mobile coverage may be patchy or altogether non-existent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whereas previously Telstra's position as the monopoly operator of fixed line phone services meant they had a regulatory obligation to ensure that all Australians had access to a standard service, the rollout of the NBN and the structural separation of Telstra means there is a need to reform the USO system. Moving from a regulatory system to a contractual system should, we are told, result in competition which will provide benefits to consumers in the long term. However, as with most policies of the current government, the devil is lurking in the detail. While the USO will technically be open to competition, the government has already signed long-term contracts with Telstra as part of its backroom deal to prop up the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these contracts are not publicly available so we are expected to take the government's word that these contracts offer value for money both to the taxpayer and to telecommunications customers. When we talk about taking the government at its word, we need not look too far back into the political history books: 'I am not going to challenge the Prime Minister for the leadership,' 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' and 'Sure thing, member for Denison, we will have poker machine reform by May.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary function of the legislation before us today is the creation of the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, which will be responsible for entering into contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth for the delivery of public interest telecommunications services including standard services, payphones, the emergency call system and the National Relay Service. TUSMA will also be responsible for ensuring voice only customers are migrated onto the NBN fibre network before Telstra's copper network is decommissioned. TUSMA will also be required to support research and development aimed at ensuring public interest services like traffic lights, and public alarm systems can migrate onto the NBN with minimal disruption, we are told.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new arrangements TUSMA will receive government funding, with residual funding requirements met by a consolidated industry levy which combines the current USO and National Relay Service levies. The government expects TUSMA's annual costs to be around $340 million—almost double the amount Telstra received in 2010-11 to provide standard phone and payphone services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill before the House is the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill which will make consequential amendments to telecommunications and other legislation related to the introduction of the TUSMA Bill. The final bill before the House is the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill, which covers the procedures by which the levy is imposed on telecommunications carriers to support the operations of TUSMA.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present the Australian Communications and Media Authority oversees the USO and collects the USO levies. This system has worked reasonably well for a number of years. However, instead of utilising this existing infrastructure, the government has decided to create an entirely new bureaucracy with a new detachment of public servants. Is anyone surprised, given that I believe the federal bureaucracy has swollen by in excess of 22,000 personnel since 2007?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new agency will have little incentive to keep expenses down, particularly as the government funding for TUSMA is fixed and any increase in costs will be borne by the telecommunications industry. Because any increase in TUSMA's costs will flow through to the industry levy, and ultimately to consumers, it is vital that TUSMA be kept efficient. That is why the coalition supports an amendment requiring ACMA's budget for a given year to be reduced by an amount equivalent to the administrative budget of TUSMA. This is to prevent overlap and duplication of costs within the two separate agencies. Furthermore, we believe the minister should be required to obtain a favourable independent review of the quality of standard services in regional areas before any potential roll-back of USO regulations can be considered. We are also concerned about the possibility of TUSMA's responsibilities being increased as part of an accounting trick to remove a few zeroes from the federal budget. At the moment, the government has committed to funding TUSMA to the tune of $100 million per year, with the budgetary shortfall to be made up by the industry levy. This creates a direct incentive for the government to shift more responsibilities on to TUSMA in the guise of public interest telecommunication services, thereby shifting the cost burden off the budget and on to industry and ultimately on to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to consider this legislation in its context. These bills would not be necessary if the government was not building the massively overcapitalised National Broadband Network. The TUSMA system was created as part of the government's backroom deal with Telstra to prop up the NBN—and propping up is exactly what the NBN is going to need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent paper by telecommunications analyst Ian Martin revealed that the NBN will have to increase revenue per customer by 5.7 per cent per year if it is to have a hope of achieving its corporate plan. This is particularly incredible when you consider just how anticompetitive the NBN really is. The NBN is so desperate to stamp out competition, they did not even bother to analyse the financial impact if Telstra's existing HFC network continued to deliver fast broadband. Instead they simply ponied up the $11 billion and then insisted Telstra shut down the rival service. Australia should be fundamentally concerned with that. But, when it comes to the NBN, it appears antitrust is the order of the day. As economics professors Joshua Gans and Jerry Hausman said in a submission to the ACCC:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We can conceive of no greater anti-competitive action than the largest mobile service provider agreeing not to compete against the monopoly fixed line provider. The result will be less innovation, higher prices and less choice for Australian consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, despite having the deck massively stacked in their favour, the NBN is still going to have to increase its prices by roughly six per cent each year just to reach its targets. The government wants to talk about its economic credibility, but this is as good as it gets. Perhaps that is because the cost of the NBN is higher than any other similar project anywhere in the world. A study by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist</span> found its price tag was 2.5 times higher than any telecommunications industry revenues and actually comprised 6.3 per cent of budget revenues. Even the Greeks in the state that they are in only committed 2.5 per cent of budget revenues to broadband.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the NBN is hiring and paying new staff but is not receiving any income from customers. In its 2010-11 annual report, it was confirmed that 531 new employers had been hired on annual salary packages of more than $220,000. That is more than you get, Jonesie. The NBN has nine top executives who were paid a total of $8.5 million, with some receiving pay rises of 20 per cent, despite internal chaos caused by top construction managers quitting midyear and a major management reshuffle in August. Meanwhile, the NBN is producing no revenue from customers. Every cent of its revenue in the 2010-11 reporting period came from interest on the $1.4 billion taxpayers have forked out so far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has all this money paid for after four years? How far along have we got? A best guess is that approximately 3,000 households have now got faster broadband. But do not worry—soon there will be no choice thanks to the deal the government has done with Telstra and Optus and you will have to sign up to the NBN. If you want broadband there is not much competition or efficiency. It is my sincere hope that the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency is not beset by similar levels of waste and mismanagement that continually plague Labor governments, who are void of policy, direction and economic credibility. We in the coalition support the intention of this bill; however, we have grave concerns about the aspects outlined.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:04</span>):  Labor stand for universal service. We stood for it in 1991 when we first introduced competition into the telecommunications industry. The universal service obligation was enshrined in the 1991 act, which was introduced into this place by the then Hawke Labor government. We stood for it when we introduced the legislation into this place to give force to the National Broadband Network because the National Broadband Network is our commitment to universal service for all Australians when it comes to access to fast, reliable, high-speed broadband—and that includes those Australians who live in the seat of the honourable member for Wright, who spoke previously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 250 pieces of legislation have been introduced into this place—as the Leader of the House is fond of reminding us. A good deal of those 250 pieces of legislation have been about implementing our plan to build a national broadband network which will connect every Australian household to the markets of Australia and the world. It beggars belief that each and every one of those pieces of legislation has been passed through this very difficult chamber in the teeth of opposition from those opposite, in the face of all logic and, in the case of my friend the honourable member for Wright, in the face of self-interest. If there were ever an electorate that was going to benefit from the rollout of the National Broadband Network, it would be his electorate as well as other electorates in regional and country Queensland that are represented by the LNP that stand to have greater access to education services, health services, businesses and markets not only in Queensland and across Australia but also all around the world. The honourable member says that as a result of this, the package of legislation and this initiative, somehow the poor members of his electorate will have no choice but to connect to the National Broadband Network. That is a little bit like complaining that the poor people who want to access electricity have no choice but to put a plug into a power point. Yes, they will. They will have access to a fast, reliable—in fact, world-beating—technology that other countries in the world are looking at with hungry eyes and envy, saying, 'Why didn't our parliament have the courage and the foresight to introduce this legislation?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is going to transform our country. It is going to transform regional Australia and we are very proud of this. This legislation, the TUSMA bill—the Telecommunications Legislation (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011—is an important part of that package of legislation because, as we transform to the National Broadband Network, it ensures we maintain the philosophy behind the universal service obligation that was inserted into that first Labor bill when we introduced competition in the telecommunications market, way back in 1991. It ensures that it is not lost in the transition but is relevant to the new telecommunications and broadband market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of bills sets up a new long-term framework for the delivery of some existing services—those that were first introduced in the 1991 legislation—but also for some new sets of arrangements. The existing services are: the universal service obligation, which ensures reasonable access to basic telephone services and to payphones for everyone irrespective of where they live in Australia; secondly, the National Relay Service, which is there for those with a speech or hearing impediment so that they too can have access to a telecommunication service; and finally, that service we hope no Australian ever needs to use but we know needs to be there, and that is the emergency call service, which has critically important arrangements for handling calls to 000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, based on Telstra's historical position as a vertically integrated operator of a national network, it has had legislative responsibility for the universal service obligation and the emergency call service. The National Relay Service is provided by two other parties under contracts with the Commonwealth. These bills put in place some new arrangements. The first is to assist in the migration of voice-only customers from the Telstra copper network to the NBN fibre network. This is because, little by little, bit by bit, we are decommissioning the copper network and translating everybody onto the new National Broadband Network—the fibre network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are many residents in electorates like mine who know that they have soggy, rotten cable running past their houses that can barely transfer a voice signal, let alone a high-speed broadband signal. They welcome the decommissioning of the rotten copper network and having it transformed to the world-beating, modern technology of the National Broadband Network's fibre optic cable. It will also assist in the development of any necessary technology solutions to support the continued provision of existing public interest services that are provided on the copper network—things like traffic lights, public alarms and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms also establish a new statutory agency, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency. It will never be known as that. Hereafter, it will be known as the TUSMA and it will have responsibility for the provision of the USO and other services through contractual and grant arrangements with third parties, as the National Relay Service is now doing. This will introduce competition and contestability to the provision of these universal services. Those who have been close to the telecommunications industry over many years will know that there are many operators within the telecommunications—particularly the service provider—market who have from time to time questioned the level of the universal service levy and the amount that they are paying to meet their commitments under the USO. So, through the open contestable grants based contractual arrangement that TUSMA will operate, we will know that there will be the best possible price and the best value for taxpayer money in the letting of these USO contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is appropriate to move to a contracting model given that the NBN rollout and Telstra's progressive structural separation of its copper network in areas covered by the NBN fibre will happen over the next 10 years. With the more competitive and open telecommunications that the NBN will promote, a contractual model over time will enable greater scope for competitive supply arrangements that in course are going to benefit consumers and indeed the entire industry, further lowering costs for these core services to end users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is great news for regional Australia as it ensures that all people, including those in regional areas—and I am advised that even in Grantham, which is a town in the electorate of Wright, whose honourable member spoke earlier—are among those who benefit from the rollout of the NBN. They will be early adapters and great advocates, I am sure. They will be petitioning the member for Wright to ensure that his party continues the rollout of the NBN not only in the electorate of Wright but throughout the rest of regional Queensland as well. That is because, under the NBN program, 70 per cent of regional Australia under our program will receive fibre to their home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already seeing real progress under the NBN program. NBN recently announced the 12-month rollout program which covers 485,000 premises. I see the member for Cunningham is in the chamber with me. We are very proud of the fact that, as a result of the work that we have done, two of those locations will be in the electorate of Throsby, in the suburb of Dapto, and the electorate of Cunningham in the suburbs surrounding Wollongong. I can tell you there is enormous excitement from businesses and the people in those areas. Far from saying, 'What are you doing spending our money rolling out the NBN in these suburbs?' the complaint is, 'When are we going to get it and can you guarantee that it is going to roll past my business or my household and, if not, why not, because we expect it? We want some of this.' If the shadow communications spokesman would care to come down to the Illawarra and meet some of the businesses and households down there, I am sure he would have cause to rethink some of the mindless opposition that the coalition has shown to the rollout of the NBN and its policy formulation process. It is really making a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, I had cause to talk with a young family who live in Kiama, in the electorate of Gilmore. This family is connected to the NBN—it was one of the pilot sites. They have two kids at university. Before they had connection to the NBN, things were like this: if one person was on the internet, everyone else had to shut everything down and you could not use the phone because that would slow speeds down to such an extent that the kids could not download their university assignments or browse the web. But, with access to the NBN, four people and a visitor can be using the NBN and additional wireless devices off a wireless router at speeds greater than three or four times that which they had previously experienced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of advocates out there who have seen the benefits and know that this really is an exciting time in telecommunications in Australia. I know that there are many potential NBN customers who are ready and waiting for the NBN to come down their street. Those opposite pretend that their inferior fibre-to-the-node and wireless offering will suffice. I can tell you that no-one is being won over by that. Those opposite expect regional Australia to make do with a second-rate broadband service, but we simply do not believe that people in regional Australia should be sold short. We believe a first-class broadband network, together with these universal service obligations, is nothing short of what regional Australia deserves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, we have seen some extraordinary statements by those opposite on broadband and telecommunications in this country. Those opposite have said that they cannot understand why we are building and designing a telecommunications network with the capacity that the National Broadband Network will have. They cannot see, as those in industry see, that rates of data transfer are increasing exponentially. What we perhaps see as massive redundancy in the system today will, within the life of this parliament, be seen as what is required to satisfy the needs of future applications. I really do ask those opposite—and I know there are many on the benches opposite who do understand this—to reconsider their policy position on this and to reconsider their attitude to the role of the internet as a critical part of the future of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, a study by Deloitte Economics found that the internet contributed around $50 billion to the Australian economy in 2010. It is estimated that that figure will, over the next three years, rise by a factor of over 30 per cent and that we are going to see a continued exponential increase in the value the internet offers to the Australian economy. For people who live in electorates like mine, who are struggling with the transformation of our economic base, this is not an optional extra; this is not a piece of technology which is just there to enable people to Skype their relatives over the other side of the country or their kids who are backpacking through Europe or to download cheap videos—as important as those things are. Quite literally, this is the technology which is going to be the tool, the highway if you like, which enables those of us in regional economies, such as the ones that the member for Cunningham and I represent, to transform our economic base and transform the way we live. The universal service obligation bills are an important part of the package of legislation we are progressively introducing into the House. I will end on the point I started on: this is a demonstration of our commitment to universal services when it comes to telecommunications in this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011. As a regional and rural member of parliament, I well understand the importance of the universal service obligation. It guarantees that vital, often life-saving, basic telephone services are always available to people, irrespective of where they live. For four years in numerous forums I have said that the south-west of Western Australia needs better communication services, including improved mobile phone and broadband services—and it certainly needs it now. This bill before the House establishes the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency and provides the framework for the new USO system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The USO is a key component of Australian telecommunications. Every Australian family and business needs access to basic communication services at a reasonable price. It is the USO which guarantees that this basic need is met. It is especially important to note that the USO primarily benefits residents in regional and remote Australia. For residents, such as those in my electorate of Forrest, access to a basic phone service is vital because other communication options are often not available or affordable. The isolation of small regional communities and individual farms means that these people are especially reliant on communications to conduct business and even to provide safety and security—there are often no immediate neighbours whose door you can knock on for assistance. Because the provision of basic phone services to regional and rural areas is often not economically viable, the subsidisation of such services is needed to ensure telephone services are accessible and affordable. The coalition strongly supports the USO and recognises the vital role the USO system plays in keeping regional Australia connected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already signed long-term contracts with Telstra to deliver the USO as part of its backroom deal to prop up the NBN. In fact, the cost of the USO actually increases from $160.5 million per annum to $340 million per annum—although the description does not seem to cover internet access, from what I can see. But contracts with Telstra are not publicly available, so we have no idea whether these contracts offer value for money either to the taxpayer or to telecommunications users. Currently the Australian Communications and Media Authority oversees the USO and collects the USO levy. Instead of utilising the existing capacity within the current system, the government has decided to create yet another new bureaucracy—the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency—with a new army of public servants coming in at a start-up administration cost of $5 million per annum. Like the new army of public servants servicing the government's carbon tax and health bureaucracies, this new agency will have little incentive to keep costs down. This is particularly relevant as government funding for TUSMA is fixed and any increase in costs will be borne by the telecommunications industry and, ultimately, consumers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the very least operators who under the Reform Bills are obliged to financially contribute to the cost of funding universal services should have had an opportunity to participate in the development of the Policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why didn't those operators have such an opportunity? To provide an incentive for the government to keep TUSMA's administrative costs in check, the opposition has moved an amendment requiring ACMA's budget for a given year to be reduced by an amount equivalent to the administrative budget of TUSMA. This amendment is intended to ensure that TUSMA's costs are not duplicated within ACMA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also very committed to ensuring that Australians in regional areas will continue to have reliable access to standard telephone services. To that end, we have moved an amendment to require the minister to obtain and secure a favourable independent review of the quality of standard telephone services before being permitted to roll back the USO regulations. This provision will ensure that an independent expert certifies that standard telephone services are of sufficient quality to justify rolling back USO regulations and will add an additional safety net within the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to ensure that the USO regulations are not rolled back too soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue I want to raise is based on the fact that in my part of the world my constituents know that the government actually promised broadband within four years, by 2013. In my electorate there are a number of areas that receive substandard communication services and I have been working to get better broadband sooner into Forrest, as have those of us on our side. The south-west of WA should have been a priority for any broadband upgrades and it is an insult to many south-west people that the Labor government is prioritising fibre rollout in metropolitan areas which already have broadband access when these services in ADSL2 are not available at all for many areas in regional and rural Australia. To add insult to injury for my constituents, the $11 billion that the Labor government has paid Telstra to scrap its network would fund not only a major upgrade of broadband but also the majority of the economic and social infrastructure needed in the south-west. Even worse, I have repeatedly requested a time frame, as my constituents will help pay for the rollout. When I have asked when it is coming to the south-west the minister fails to answer that question. So I am asking once again: when will it be rolled out? The Labor government have been in office for nearly five years. In 2007, they promised us a national broadband network, to be finished by 2013. Five years on, where is it in my electorate? Businesses and individuals need certainty. They need to know exactly which areas will receive fibre to the premises and which areas will be serviced by wireless services and who will be connected by satellite—in my electorate very important. These key questions remain unanswered, to the intense shame of both the minister and the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN plans show that a number of smaller regional centres currently accessing ADSL will be migrated to wireless services. This will see a centre like Northcliffe in the south-west, currently receiving a 20 megabits per second download speed on ADSL2, drop to a maximum of 12 megabits per second delivered by NBN satellite—to say nothing of the latency issues! And we are yet to hear exactly how each town and community—places like Nannup and Balingup for instance—will be affected and what proportion of the NBN will be strung out on overhead cables. The south-west has experienced at least five major fires already this summer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN rollout is on a 10-year never-never plan and I understand that currently the NBN has connected only 4,000 households. The south-west might have to wait another decade and technology will have moved on in that time. We already know that the NBN is behind schedule and missing key deadlines—the CEO has actually said so. Without a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis or evidence of commercial viability of this project, the government's NBN is delivering delays and uncertainty at a massive cost of $50 billion and still counting. The total cost is yet to be determined while at the same time the government is doing everything it can to avoid scrutiny and accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community still has great concern that a government plagued by mismanagement and incompetence will be able to deliver this project on time and on budget, although we do not even know what the budget is. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications Journal of Australia</span>, RBS telecommunications analyst Ian Martin published a paper showing the NBN will have to increase revenue per customer by 5.7 per cent a year to meet its corporate plan. For those on lower incomes, higher prices will deepen the divide between the digital haves and have-nots. The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network have made some statements as well on this issue and they are also very concerned, Madam Deputy Speaker.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NBN Co.'s plan to hit broadband consumers in their hip pocket for the next 30 years by asking the Australian Communications and Media Authority for the right to lift prices on all of its services, except one, by five per cent above inflation every year was recently exposed by the coalition. In October NBN Co. backed down, but it still has not explained its pricing strategy or updated its corporate plan. I support the amendments that have been moved by the coalition in relation to this legislation. As I have said previously, this is of great concern in my electorate. As we know, it is a never-never plan. I have frequently argued for better broadband in my electorate and I believe that under the coalition's plan that would have been delivered by this time. When the Labor government came to power in 2007 it promised to deliver better broadband by 2013. It is now 2012 and people in my electorate have not seen any improvement in broadband.</span>

                  <a href="96430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EWEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:32</span>):  My purpose in speaking tonight is to recognise the winners and the high achievers in the Townsville Australia Day awards. I would like to quickly go through them and tell you who won what and then go back and speak to a couple.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Citizen of the Year was one of the most well deserved recipients in the history of the awards, Garth Harrigan. Community Event of the Year was the fantastic 60th Anniversary of National Service. The Cultural Award was awarded to Connie Hoedt, a ceramic artist. Young Citizen of the Year was Emily Michelle Moore. The Junior Sports Award was to Shelby Green, an 11-year-old BMX rider. The Senior Sports Award went to Penny Palfrey. Sports Administrator Award was to Bill Whitburn, who shared it with Chris Schell, narrowly nudging out Jayne Arlett, who is the managing partner in Townsville Podiatry, and who also saved Townsville Fire, an Australian Women's National Basketball League team, from extinction. That just shows you how good these sports administrators are. The Spirit of Townsville awards went to Warren Hegarty, Gwenda Richardson and Neighbour to Neighbour Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia Day honours in North Queensland also went to Dr Dorothy Gibson-Wilde, who received a Medal of the Order of Australia for services to heritage preservation in Queensland. Anyone who has crossed swords with Dorothy when it comes to the historical village in Townsville will know what they have come up against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Jon Stephenson, who died a year ago, was awarded a Member in the awards. During the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1958 he became the first Australian to reach the South Pole. Dr Donat Gallagher was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to the arts and education and to the community of Townsville. Finally, Norma Connolly was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the sport of basketball through administration and coaching roles on some 382 occasions. That is what you have to do in Townsville to get nominated for an award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Citizen of the Year was Garth Harrigan, who serves as chairman of the Townsville and Thuringowa Transport Solutions, or NQ Community Transport. He has been a volunteer since retiring three times in the past 34 years. That we had a nominee in Professor Ajay Rane, who has done women's surgery on a volunteer basis in Tibet and Africa, speaks volumes for what Garth is all about. He is about the community and making it a richer place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 60th Anniversary of National Service was a truly great community event, driven locally by local people. Warren Hegarty, who won a Spirit of Townsville Award, is the chairman of the Townsville Nashos. My dad was in the second intake in 1952, when it was only three months. He is still very proud of being a Nasho. Most of the guys there were Vietnam veterans and guys who had served real time and had real experience. It was a great afternoon and a great week. They had a lot to do with it being a truly wonderful community event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young Citizen of the Year was Emily Michelle Moore. Not only did she attend the Rotary Youth Enrichment Program and also the International Youth Forum in Missouri, USA, but she also organised, led and contributed in many fundraising events, including those for the Cancer Council, the Leukaemia Foundation and the Abused Child Trust. She was also school captain of Kirwan State High School and a fag paper away from getting an OP1. She is a tremendous girl and she will be someone to watch in future years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shelby Green is 11 years old and captain of Australia's BMX squad that went to New Zealand. She was unbeaten in all her rides. She won in Australia but unfortunately lost in New Zealand, but she was captain from Townsville in the sport of BMX.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penny Palfrey was awarded a Senior Sports Award. Penny holds the world record for the longest ever open water swim, between Little and Grand Cayman islands in June 2011. She also broke the record for swimming the Molokai channel, Hawaii. She has been nominated for the title of World Open Water Swimmer of the year for the fourth year in a row. She also swam between Magnetic Island and Townsville without a cage some 20 times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Whitburn has worked in Aussie Rules for many years. He is an ADF veteran and a tremendous bloke. Next is Chris Schell, who is involved in netball.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I would like to specifically mention Gwenda Richardson, a tremendous lady who was told by her doctor to get out and walk more. So she went out with her three-legged dog and started picking up rubbish. In a Forrest Gump style of thing she just never stopped. She kept on picking up rubbish and did a wonderful job for Townsville. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:37</span>):  Three years ago the landscape of McEwen was changed forever, changed by the unstoppable force and fury of the worst bushfire this nation has ever witnessed. On this day, 7 February, in 2009, Black Saturday became a scar on the hearts and minds of the McEwen electorate. One hundred and seventy-three people paid the ultimate price on that day and numerous more have since. No-one was untouched in this disaster: friends, families and neighbours were affected directly and indirectly. As the night wore on and as daylight began to break the following morning, we stood and surveyed the enormity of what had happened: towns, communities, houses and property were gone, reduced to ashes in a landscape totally barren but for the smouldering remains of the fury just past. The following days melded into a blur for many people as the loss of their homes, possessions and precious memories started to sink in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What followed this disaster was a story that can only belong to Australia, a story of mateship in its truest form. People who had witnessed what had happened, from all over the country, from all points of the land, stepped up and gave their all to help those who had lost everything. Politics were put aside as the nation rallied because our people, our mates, were hurting. Our country stood up to lend a hand. It is ingrained in my mind and the minds of those in my communities that, when our very existence was threatened by nature's fury, amidst the tragedy, loss and senselessness of the day, many heroes arose to stand tall. The tales of personal sacrifice and willingness to pitch in and give a hand will never cease to amaze me. One such story is of a lady in Wandong who came to see me; she had just learnt that she and her family had nothing left, but her husband still had his truck and she wanted to know how they could use that truck, their only possession, to help others. That is the true Aussie spirit of mateship and it makes me continually proud and honoured to represent the seat of McEwen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let us fast-forward to today, three years on after this tragic event. The green has returned; homes and businesses continue to rebuild and to grow. I have witnessed in this new normal how the Black Saturday legacy has bonded our communities and our people together, paving the way for a united future in the area. It has been so encouraging to see thousands of tourists flocking back to Marysville, the Kinglake Ranges, Flowerdale, Strathewen, St Andrews and many other towns, ready to experience the many delights of our region. Small businesses, old and new, are opening, the flora and fauna are thriving and wherever you go people are optimistic and excited by the future prospects for their region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently I joined the Prime Minister in Flowerdale for a great occasion on which we honoured some of the heroes of Black Saturday with National Emergency Medals. To see over the past three years the regeneration and rebuilding of the area has been quite humbling. The process of healing is well underway and I would like to take this opportunity to again pass on my sincere thanks and gratitude to the volunteers who make our electorate so special. What we have endured has not been easy—in fact it has been a hard slog—but it is a testament to the people of McEwen that we are ready and prepared for the challenges of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I received an email which said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This year, the third since Black Saturday, feels like a turning point—as though we are gaining more forward momentum than before. My community is different—it has changed irrevocably since that day—but not all that change has been bad. This change was inevitable and could not be resisted. Time has allowed us to come to terms with it and to realise that, though it took a severe blow, hope did not die that day. Of course the recovery process has been different for everyone and there are those who still have some way to go. However, the community is showing signs of strength and renewal that will allow it to better support those who are still struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So as I sit in my new house and look around at all the physical change that surrounds me, my emotions ebbing and flowing, I am reminded of all those who extended a helping hand when we most needed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again—your kindness and generosity is not forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">kind regards</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Kathy</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to say on this, the third anniversary of Black Saturday, that we remember the lives lost and honour their legacy, but now is the time for consolidation as the rebuilding of our communities goes on. We will be back bigger and better than ever before. As Murrindindi Shire Mayor John Walsh recently said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... let's not define the Shire by the fires, rather, let's look on 2009 as a new beginning, rather than an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree wholeheartedly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="FU4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:42</span>):  Many people in my Melbourne bayside electorate of Goldstein rely for their jobs on the light and mid-tier manufacturing hub situated on the doorstep of my electorate in the Moorabbin and Braeside areas. This hub straddles parts of the electorates of the member for Isaacs and the member for Hotham, and in many ways I am speaking on their behalf with my comments tonight. It is the largest concentration of mid-tier manufacturing in Australia, with an output of over $5 billion from some 8,000 businesses, employing over 70,000 people. This is a centre of innovation and value-add: highly productive enterprises making a major contribution to both the local and national economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Its history lies over the last 30 or 40 years. Often these thousands of small and mid-tier businesses have moved on to the next generation of family members and leadership. Often they have moved well up the high-tech value-added chain to stay competitive, spending a considerable fortune in many cases on new technology, adding value to some simpler process that their parents or their predecessors started the business with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These companies have been paying the price for the Gillard government's manic borrowing, which has pushed up interest rates and reduced the companies' access to finance for three years now. Yet, incredibly, Labor are still in the market borrowing $100 million a day. Every day they are out there competing against these 8,000 companies who are trying to access finance at a rate that allows them to keep their doors open. The average small business overdraft rate, for example, under this government is 10.23 per cent compared to an average of 8.89 per cent under Costello during his time in government. This represents the real borrowing costs to business, yet this government continues to show both its naivety and its lack of empathy by pointing to the base rate of 4.25 per cent. It is irrelevant to these small and mid-tier businesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2007, the spread between the RBA cash rate and the average small business unsecured overdraft was 355 basis points. In January 2012 the spread was 600 basis points. Unfortunately, the Treasurer and finance minister have no understanding of, or empathy for, these facts. The record shows that a typical small business with an unsecured overdraft of some $200,000 was on average $223 a month better off under the coalition. Under this government, there is also an enormous extra pressure on local businesses in securing loans and rolling over their borrowing requirements. Many have had to close their doors because finance is not available because the government has been in the market for another $100 million every day of every week for the last three years. That is why we have a debt heading towards $136 billion—the biggest in our history. Compounding this situation for a number of local businesses, many of them in export markets, is the high Australian dollar. Again, Labor's loose fiscal policy has placed upward pressure on the exchange rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talks about fiscal consolidation, yet its spending in this year's budget alone is $100 million more than it spent in the 2007-08 budget. That is more than a 35 per cent increase in this year alone. What household could sustainably increase their spending by nearly 40 per cent over any three-year period? It is impossible without pushing up pressures on their budget and their ability to stay in good economic shape. On top of all this, this government is whacking on a carbon tax. It is madness. One company from my area with a $200 million business, who saw me yesterday and talked me through their situation, said that, after modelling the carbon tax, they are going to face a new annual tax of $1 million—one business and no compensation. Think of the impact that is going to have on jobs for decades to come in this local area of mine.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:52</span>):  As the House adjourns and the member for Goldstein retires to contemplate how he will fill the $70 billion black hole in the opposition's proposed budget, I would like to make a few observations about governing in the interests of working people and the concept of a social compact between employer and employee and between government and business. I acknowledge at the outset that this compact is changing, particularly between employer and employee. No longer do employees have lifetime employment as the norm. Indeed, over one million Australians change their job each year and 1.4 million Australians are engaged in a way that 10 years ago we would have described as 'nontraditional'. More and more businesses buy and sell on an international stage and employees now contribute as much as their employers do in terms of money and time to their own vocational education and training. Indeed, working hours are increasing and the boundaries between work and home are dissolving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parallel with these changes is a demand from business that their relationship between themselves and their employees be governed more by trust than by regulation and the relationship between government and business be one that facilitates rather than regulates their business. These on their face are reasonable requests but requests which are all too often undermined by the action of their advocates. We can have little sympathy for employers who decry the role of an independent umpire, for example, in the resolution of industrial disputes but then lock out their workforce and cripple a country's aviation system in the midst of an industrial dispute. There are employers who demand more trust and commitment and time from their workforce but reward that trust and commitment by increased casualisation, precarious employment or the off-shoring of jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Employees are quite rightly demanding a reciprocal obligation from their employers. With equal force, Australians grow tired of businesses who decry regulation while seeking assistance or concessions. I have spoken at great length in this place about the need for government to assist and facilitate business to make strategic interventions in the market where those interventions are aimed at delivering a greater social good than the roaming hand of the unfettered market would otherwise deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand by what I have said. I believe that we need an auto industry in this country. I think it is critical to the future of our nation, its intelligence and how we produce and consume. I think to that end the Automotive Transformation Scheme is critical. I believe the coalition's policy will destroy the automotive industry in this country. I believe we have a need for a steel industry in this country—a clean, modern, high-tech steel industry, and I believe the steel industry transformation plan and the $300 million associated with that by this government will assist. I believe the coalition's refusal to back that plan is a clear threat to the future of the steel industry. I believe that it is incumbent  on these businesses to show a reciprocal obligation to Australian taxpayers and their workers. The obligation should include an obligation to keep jobs onshore, to train the next generation of workers to invest in modern equipment, plant and processes and to ensure that their middle management force is up to the task of meeting the challenges of the future. These are not radical socialist ideals. Indeed, the President of the United States recently reflected a very similar sentiment in his address to congress, the address to the nation. I say to businesses quite clearly that your failure to meet your side in this compact, your side of the reciprocal obligation, will not go unchecked. There are many areas of government policy where government is facilitating the demands of businesses: for instance, in the area of 457 visas, industrial assistance, tax relief and industrial relations reform, which are providing real and everyday benefits to business. Indeed, these are a continuation of reform that we have seen since 1983. We have seen an unprecedented shift towards opening up our economy and freeing up our markets. We should not assume that this will be an uninterrupted trajectory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian people as consumers, as neighbours and as voters will respond to the continuing offshoring of jobs on the one hand as business with the other hand holds its hands out to government and demands more and more concessions and more are more assistance. Quite simply, the Australian people will not accept this. So I say to business tonight: the ball is in your court. You must meet your part of the bargain or the rules will certainly change. They will change as Australian governments of all persuasions respond to an Australian population which is demanding a more vigorous response from its governments to the challenges that people are facing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:53</span>):  I rise tonight to express my support for the introduction into Australia of a new cancer treatment called CyberKnife. This is a remarkable technology that has the capacity to save or improve the lives of hundreds of people who are suffering from cancer. In short, it provides a more targeted radiotherapy treatments so that less damage is done to non-cancerous parts of the body. It is available in 26 other countries and should be available here, particularly at our leading cancer hospital, the Peter McCollum Cancer Centre in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">CyberKnife was brought to my attention by two of my constituents, Mr and Mrs Keith and Jenny Slater, who came to see me last year seeking my support for its introduction. At the time, Mr and Mrs Slater's teenage granddaughter, Kahlia, was in late stages of a rare bone cancer. They informed me of all the treatments that she had endured in Australia, but nothing was beating the wasting disease. This is when they decided to head to India, the most accessible place for Kahlia to get CyberKnife treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The results were impressive. When Kahlia made the journey for her treatment in July last year, she boarded the plane in her wheelchair. When she came home, she pushed the wheelchair herself, and for the next three months she enjoyed, according to Mr and Mrs Slater, just being a normal teenager again, such was the tremendous impact of the treatment. Sadly, however, after several months the tumours grew again and she became unable to take the long journey back to India.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brave young fighter touched the hearts of the nation in her appearance on Channel 7 late last year. The local papers followed her journey, which inspired other teens and readers across the board. Locals and fellow students at Norwood Secondary College pitched in to help raise the $80,000 needed to get Kahlia to India and pay for CyberKnife treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teen cancer patients have been called the forgotten sufferers as there is quite high awareness of the disease and programs for children and for seniors but there is less for teenagers. It is because of this that I want to bring this matter to the attention of the parliament and to press for the speedy processing of the CyberKnife application. Mr David Speakman, Executive Director of Clinical Services at the Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, says that CyberKnife has two important benefits above existing treatments in Australia. First, it delivers a far more targeted radiotherapy treatment, significantly minimising the damage to non-cancerous parts of the body. Second, it enables radiotherapy to be delivered to some patients that otherwise could not receive radiotherapy, in particular younger people and some other special cases. Mr Speakman strongly endorses the CyberKnife treatment and says that it would be a valuable addition to the treatments available at the Peter McCallum Centre. He says that current stereotactic radio surgeries using modified linear accelerators are reaching the end of their use-by date. He suggests that this technology would only cost about $4.5million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that Western Australia has announced plans to purchase the technology. The leading cancer centre, Peter McCallum in Melbourne, should also have it. As well as having the treatment available locally, it is vital for it to receive Medical Services Advisory Committee approval so that these oncology services can be claimed under Medicare by the people who need it most: cancer sufferers with limited resources of their own. I am informed by the Minister for Health, who I have written to about this, that an application is currently before MSAC and is in stage 3 of an 11-stage process. Whilst I certainly uphold our system of checks and balances inherent in the MSAC process, I also want to press the urgency of pushing through this process rapidly for the benefit of the many families touched by the ravages of cancer. I note that this treatment is available in 26 other countries, including the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, China, Italy, India, and South Korea. It is clearly not an experimental treatment but one that is widespread elsewhere. It is time we had it here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We could never know for sure what Khalia's prospects would have been had she had CyberKnife treatment in Australia from the start, but, given the success of the treatment she had from her first trip to India, it may well have made a significant difference. Sadly, Kahlia passed away on December 20 of last year. The sparky teenager asked for pink to be worn at her funeral. Consequently, many of the hundreds who farewelled her were dressed in her favourite colour. Pink balloons floated above her pink coffin, signifying a brave and gentle spirit, who is deeply and sadly missed by her grieving family, friends and community. In her honour, Mr and Mrs Slater have vowed to fight for others in similar situations and particularly for the introduction of CyberKnife. I commend their commitment and proudly support them in their efforts. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="WF6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:58</span>):  Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your new position. During the January break I had the opportunity to participate in presenting a view of Australia to the foreign affairs committee of the Italian parliament in Rome on 20 January. Many of the arguments I raised with the 16 Italian MPs present at a private hearing were drawn from some of the brilliant arguments—that is the only way I can describe them—in Mr Peter Hartcher, the international affairs editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>'s, article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spectator</span>, 'The envy of the world', and in his great book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sweet Spot</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I explained to the Italian parliamentarians that going into 2011 Australia's unemployment rate of five per cent was half that of Europe or America. As <span style="font-style:italic;">Le</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mond</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>said, 'Australia astonishes'. Australia has a higher average income per head of population these days than Germany, Japan, Singapore and France. It is a figure 1½ times that of its mother country, Britain. For the first time since the First World War income per head surpassed the United States. Perhaps it is too new, or too incredible, Mr Hartcher argued, for Australians to absorb, but the country has now become such a prosperous modern power that we can afford to take a little credit for winning the real prizes of international life. In its annual ranking of countries on earth, the United Nations combines measures of income, education and health to create the Human Development Index, Mr Hartcher explained. In its 2010 assessment of 194 countries, Australia scored second only to Norway in enjoying the best living conditions available to humans. Australia in 2011 surpassed Norway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A second opinion is offered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in its Better Life Index, which measures the economies of the world's 34 developed countries. Again Australia is at the top. This was not simply accomplished, I explained to my Italian interlocutors, by digging gold and other resources out of the ground. In fact, the mining industry constitutes only 8 per cent of the Australian economy. But perhaps I am proudest of the explanation that Mr Hartcher developed in his article and in his book that one of the distinctive characteristics of the Australian model was that we have achieved all of this—sound growth, high living standards and the protections of a social security net—while living within our means. Mr Hartcher asks: is Australia so now dependent on mining that we must owe everything to the commodities boom? He answers that question very clearly. Even at the peak of the boom, Australia's entire energy and mining sectors constituted only 8.4 per cent of the national economy in 2010. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's accomplishment is far greater than generating wealth and services for an elite. The rich can live well in any country; that is no achievement. The wider picture is that Australia is one of the world's fairest countries, one of the most tolerant and one of the safest. Against the tide of events in the rest of the world, Australia's income equality has become less unequal. The rich have got richer and the poor have not got poorer—the gap between them has actually narrowed. This really impressed my interlocutors in Italy. So Australia has managed to become one of the richest, most confident countries in the world in its financial wealth, perhaps the richest of all in its living conditions and also rich in its spirit of fairness and cohesion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of my remarks, summarising these findings of Mr Hartcher based on hard evidence from the OECD and the United Nations, my friend the deputy of the Independent Republican Party, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, sprang to his feet, banged the table and denounced the chairman of the Italian Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Stefano Stefani. I was a little taken aback until the next sentence came. Mr La Malfa said, 'How can you invite this man to speak to our committee to outline the great economic progress Australia has made compared to Italy? It is a shame and makes Italians feel ashamed.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not have Mr La Malfa's pessimism about Italy. It is a great country, it is a centre of culture and of course it will emerge from the European economic crisis. But we have a great deal to be confident about in our great country, and the cries of horror orchestrated by the Leader of the Opposition with his $70 billion black hole nonbudget and his constant decrying of Australia's borrowing overseas—six per cent of GDP compared to Japan, 100 per cent, and other places much more—are really a disgrace. Australia is a confident, exciting and vital country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:03</span>):  At the beginning of this 2012 parliamentary year I rise to discuss important issues and recent developments in the suburb of Belmont in my electorate of Swan. I heard the previous member talking about opposition leaders, and Belmont happens to be in the state seat of the former opposition leader in Western Australia, Eric Ripper. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past I have spoken about the Belmont Medicare office and Belmont HBF office—two important health facilities that we managed to secure through Belmont community campaigns, with the Medicare office opening in 2009 and the HBF office opening in 2010. Today I am pleased to be able to say that following some joint work with the Canning division of GPs we have managed to secure a new after-hours service for Belmont. My involvement in this issue started back in 2010 after I was approached by Rodney Redmond and the Canning Division of General Practice for assistance with the proposed healthcare boundaries. Original federal government plans for the new healthcare boundaries would have seen Belmont split away from the Canning division to become part of a Northern Suburbs administrative division. This decision would have put at risk a project in the pipeline by the Canning division for an after-hours GP service at Belvidere Street, which was close to being launched by the division. I must say that it is a much needed after-hours GP service as well; Belmont happens to have one of the lowest SES rankings in Western Australia. I joined forces with the Canning division to stop this partition of our local health board and fortunately, after a couple of drafts, the department saw our point of view and reconfigured the boundaries. Last time I checked the centre was scheduled to open mid-year. I am sure the new after-hours GP service will be well used and highly valued by the Belmont community. I would like to thank the Canning division and Rodney Redmond for all the great work they have done on this project and for all the work they continue to do right across the Canning division. I also take the opportunity to thank the member for Brand for his input into the process as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I am pleased to be able to announce that through working with the City of Belmont we have managed to achieve a half a million dollar grant for a special Belmont community program. The program will subsidise the costs of a number of physical activity, healthy eating and healthy lifestyle programs for City of Belmont residents. This was a project I worked particularly closely on with the council CEO, Stuart Cole, and former Mayor Glenys Godfrey. I hosted them in my office last year during a parliamentary sitting week as we made a major effort to advocate for this funding for the Belmont community. Again, I acknowledge the support and assistance given by the previous minister for health, Ms Roxon. We managed to get them in to see Ms Roxon's advisers. We particularly put forward the fact of Belmont's low-SES rating and the fact that it had not had any grants for a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made previous speeches in this place on the WellingTONNE Challenge—a healthy living program which we investigated through the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. I note that the member for Parkes is also a member of the committee. The committee produced a report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Weighing it up</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> obesity in Australia</span>. Since then it has been one of my goals to get a scheme like this active in Swan. Through this program we have managed to achieve this for the people of Belmont. I hope as many people as possible will take part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another recent development in the city of Belmont has been some positive news for residents of Gild Street in Cloverdale, who approached me about a road safety issue they were dealing with. After being contacted last year by Gild Street residents about road safety at the Belmont Avenue and Fulham Street roundabout, I held an onsite community meeting, to which there was a good turnout. Following the meeting I made a submission to the council, and I am pleased to say that there has been some progress. The council has applied for federal black spot funding to fund traffic calming measures at this roundabout. The council has informed me that should funding not be granted it will likely include the project in its 2012-13 municipal works program to ensure the intersection is made safe. Unfortunately, the further action was taken on this because there was a death in the community nearby, which was a road safety issue as well. I would like to thank the Gild Street community for alerting me to this issue and I hope the planned works will improve road safety in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to mention the fantastic Australia Day event run by the City of Belmont RSL Club this year, which I attended. This was the first time for many years that the City of Belmont has supported this event but I am sure that it will be the first of many as it was such a success and a credit to the club for organising it. I congratulate the winners of awards on the day, including Anne Owens and Brian Robinson, who won City of Belmont RSL Appreciation Awards; Dot Balcombe and Bob Poole, who received certificates of service and past secretary certificates; former Mayor Glenys Godfrey, who received an RSL Certificate of Appreciation; and Mr Peter Passeri, a former mayor of Belmont, who won the inaugural City of Belmont RSL Australian of the Year award for his contribution over 15 years to the Belmont community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (22<span class="HPS-Time">:08</span>): If there is one prediction we can confidently make about the Australia of the future it is that our nation will become more ethnically diverse and more enmeshed with Asia. Since the end of the White Australia Policy the share of our migrants coming from non-English-speaking countries has continued to grow. The effects of this immigration can be seen in the diverse cuisine now available in our restaurants, but that is just a superficial picture of how migration has affected the nation. In thousands of workplaces today Australians are drawing on the culture and experiences of nearly every nation on the globe. At the same time, the growth of China and India is placing us closer than ever to the economic centre of gravity of the world economy. This is not just a mining story—in fact, Australia's service exports to China exceed our coal exports. It is a story that illuminates the evolution of our national character. The next generation of Australians will be more likely to have been born in Asia, travelled to Asia, worked in Asia or married someone from Asia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To look at the economic and social opportunities that this change provides, the Prime Minister has commissioned former Treasury Secretary Ken Henry to produce a white paper on the Asian century. Dr Henry will be assisted by an advisory panel: Peter Drysdale, John Denton, Catherine Livingstone, Gordon de Brouwer, David Gruen and Heather Smith. Submissions for the white paper close on 26 February, and I encourage interested groups and individuals to make a submission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Growing engagement with Asia means that the parliament needs to keep increasing our Asia literacy. We can be proud to have a Mandarin-speaking foreign minister and representatives of Asian descent such as Senators Penny Wong and Lisa Singh. I hope we can welcome more Nguyens, Desais and Zhangs into this parliament over the years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of us have spent time living in Asia. One of the things I have found since coming into parliament is that I have increasingly drawn on my own background growing up as a child in Malaysia and Indonesia, and I have had the chance to tell the stories of people like Jamie Mackie and Herb Feith, who helped forge our nation's relationship with the region. Thanks to the encouragement of Melanie Tait, I even told the tale of my time as an AusAID brat recently as part of ABC 666's 'Now Hear This' event last December. It was a daunting and rewarding experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a local member of parliament, a diverse Canberra is a great source of pride for me. This week, the Canberra Multicultural Festival will be held in my electorate. The festival celebrates differences by showcasing the art, music, dance and food of culturally rich Canberra. The face of the festival is German immigrant Wolf Blass. Performers will include Troy Cassar-Daley, Anthony Callea and Joe Dolce. The event involves 200 community groups, local and national arts groups, up to 70 diplomatic missions, numerous businesses and tens of thousands of people who attend the three-day festival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the summer months, it has been my pleasure to speak at a number of multicultural functions in my electorate. In December, I attended the launch of the new premises for the National Ethnic Disability Alliance in the Theo Notaras Multicultural Centre. I have also had the pleasure of speaking at the Karen New Year celebrations in Cook and the Mon National Day celebrations in at Merici College in Braddon. Both the Karen and Mon communities have proud histories, yet continue to be repressed by the Burmese government. I particularly acknowledge the valuable work of Karen community leaders Nai Shin Thu, Ester Kyaw and Saw Tha Wah, and Mon community leaders Nai Tin Aye, Nai Pe Them Zar, Nai Loka Chanmi and Hongsar Channaibanya.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is fortunate to have many champions of multiculturalism, including Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Lundy; ACT Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Joy Burch; her director, Nic Manikis; Kathy Ragless of Companion House; John Gunn of the ACT Multicultural Youth Services; and many others who work to resettle refugees, including Geoff McPherson, David Cran and Bevil Purnell.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I congratulate Sam Wong, who was announced by the Prime Minister last month as one of only 40 'People of Australia Ambassadors' for 2012. As an ambassador Sam will strengthen our capacity as a nation to bring people together and build bridges of understanding and respect.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:13</span>):  As I stand here tonight, right across northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, we are seeing a massive flood. In my electorate of Parkes we have seen flood levels that we have not seen for 60 years. The cost to the local community has been enormous. Towns like Moree and Narrabri have seen inundation. We have seen small businesses affected. We have seen householders dealing with water going through their homes. We have seen hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage to crops, farm infrastructure and council infrastructure such as roads and bridges. That is going to go on for some time. As the water from New South Wales converges with the water from southern Queensland, where it meets the Barwon River and finally the Darling River, we are going to see flooding in towns like Bourke, Brewarrina and Walgett for many weeks to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few days, as I have flown over this flooded area and inspected the damage, what has been brought home to me is the massive force that is the Murray-Darling Basin. We are seeing that nature, not mankind, is in control of the basin. We are seeing water running with scant regard to man-made infrastructure, the way it has for hundreds of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has also become obvious is the complexity of the Murray-Darling Basin system. We saw how the two floods in the Gwydir River during the last three months behaved differently. The results depend on the intensity, location and timing of rainfall events and the reaction of different streams. As we come to terms as a community and a country with managing the Murray-Darling Basin, we should realise the complexity of what we are dealing with. The Murray-Darling Basin is not a plasticine model in a laboratory where you can put water in at point A and it will come out at point B. And flooding is not just from major rivers; we are seeing flooding from streams that are virtually unknown, like Tallaba Creek, causing massive damage in villages like Rowena, where hundreds of thousands of tonnes of grain have been damaged by floodwaters and the local cotton gin has a metre of water through it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we are rushing through this artificial time frame to come up with a Murray-Darling Basin plan, it is very important that we stop and think about what is going on. A lot of the speeches in this place over the four years that I have been here have been made looking through the prism of 10 years of drought. We have heard many speeches about the stressed river system. Indeed, after the massive drought we had, that was the case. But the Murray-Darling Basin is resilient, and, as soon as the water returned, the system came to life. We have had several seasons now of bird breeding. We have seen the replenishment of the underground water system. We have seen agricultural production come back to life. It would be a great tragedy if we reduced the ability of this community, this basin and this country to produce wealth and to feed itself because of a lack of understanding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />From consultations I have had with bureaucrats from the basin authority, it has become very clear to me that there is no understanding of the complexity and the variations that can occur. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority at this stage has not announced any hearings in this final round, in an electorate that covers 24 per cent of the Murray-Darling Basin. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:19</span>):  The residents of Dinmore, Riverview and Redbank who live along the Ipswich Motorway have more travel choices thanks to the opening of two new service roads and a new pedestrian bridge. On 3 February 2012, I was pleased to be with the member for Oxley, the state member for Bundamba, Mrs Jo-Ann Miller, and the Queensland Minister for Main Roads, Fisheries and Marine Infrastructure, the Hon. Craig Wallace, to open the Tessman Street pedestrian bridge, which connects the north side of Riverview to the south side of Riverview, and a new service road that runs from Aberdare Street all the way down to Law Street so that residents can avoid going on the Ipswich Motorway when they travel to, for example, Redbank Plaza. This has great implications because residents of Ipswich Central regularly go to Redbank Plaza to go to the movies, to do their shopping or to work. It is a major shopping centre in Ipswich and this will make a big difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right from the start we said that the Ipswich Motorway was a vital infrastructure project in South-East Queensland. It was supported by all the local councils and the state coalition opposition, but it was opposed repeatedly and emphatically by those opposite through three elections in a row. The southern service road will take up to 5,000 vehicles a day off the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway, which is used by up to 95,000 vehicles a day, travelling between Ipswich and Brisbane. I have about 84,500 residents in the electorate of Blair who can vote me in or out at the next election. With 95,000 vehicles a day travelling through this section of the motorway, you can see why I so often speak on this topic. This piece of infrastructure is vital for not just the lifestyles but the lives of the people on the western corridor between Ipswich and Brisbane. We have seen a new service road towards Redbank as well, which has made a big difference to the people along the motorway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the opening of the yellow pedestrian bridge at Tessman Street. I was pleased to be at the community day held the day after the opening. The Tessman Street bridge is three metres wide and has a ramp and stair access, anti-throw screens for safety and a pedestrian rest stop on the southern side. As I said, it is yellow and easily identified. I want to thank Mick O'Dwyer of Origin Alliance—he is the manager—and his team. Origin Alliance, who were doing the construction on the Ipswich motorway between Dinmore and Goodna, have a saying: 'Safe work, safe travel, safely home.' I also thank Cindy Thomas, the community engagement manager, and her team for putting on the community day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to Origin Alliance, who received the QMCA 2011 Project Safety Excellence Award. They are creating a legacy, with jobs being created—4,250 jobs on the Dinmore to Goodna section alone—but they are also giving apprenticeships to Indigenous locals. I also want to thank them for the charity that they have extended and the money they have raised through various fun days for prostate cancer and breast cancer research. They have taken it upon themselves to really be part of the local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly thank someone who I have not mentioned all that often in parliament, and that is a guy who goes by the name of Mango Murphy. Mango Murphy is the program director for the western corridor and for main roads in Queensland. He has been an absolute champion of the Ipswich Motorway upgrade and has strongly advocated it for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, this government, are investing a record amount of money in Queensland in road and port infrastructure—$8.5 billion. That is more than double what the Howard coalition government put in. Road infrastructure funding in my area is probably the greatest demonstration of the difference between a Labor government that believes in doing things and a coalition government that, when in power, believes in inertia, idleness and ignorance when it comes to road infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Roads are key in my electorate. They are so important. Things like the Warrego Highway, the Brisbane Valley Highway and the Ipswich Motorway connect people. They connect communities, towns, farmers, businesses and workers. The coalition has opposed every road funding commitment in my electorate in the last four years, and the Ipswich Motorway is the worst example.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:24</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on Australia's foreign investment policy and what I believe is a glaring anomaly. The government states that it reviews foreign investment against the national interest case by case, that it prefers the flexible approach to hard and fast rules, that a case-by-case approach maximises investment flows while protecting Australia's interests and that it recognises community concerns about foreign ownership of certain Australian assets. And it does seem to be the case that this is true when it comes to residential real estate. But, sadly, it is not when it comes to rural properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residential real estate is defined by the government as all land and housing that is not commercial property or rural land. In this regard, residential real estate includes vacant land that can be used for residential purposes, hobby farms and rural residential blocks. Regardless of value, foreign persons generally need to notify the government to take an interest in residential real estate—and, as the Foreign Investment Review Board has acknowledged, that includes a one-bedroom unit—or to buy shares or units in Australian urban land corporations or trust estates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though commercial property and rural land are not classed as residential real estate, special rules exist for commercial real estate. Foreign persons also need to notify if they want to take an interest in developed commercial real estate that is valued at $53 million or more, unless the real estate is heritage listed—then, a $5 million threshold applies. And, when it comes to vacant land, foreign persons need to apply to buy or take an interest in land for commercial development, including to start a forestry business, regardless of the value of the land. Compare this to what happens to Australian agricultural land. A foreign person needs approval to buy an interest in a primary production business where the total assets exceed $244 million. As will be highlighted in the media tomorrow, it would seem that we are now starting to see Australian farms being advertised for sale to help foreign persons in their attempts to migrate to Australia, an issue I will now be asking the Senate inquiry into the Foreign Investment Review Board national interest test to take a look at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are the questions I would like answered. Why do vacant blocks, hobby farms and rural residential blocks require a foreign person to get prior approval to acquire an interest, no matter what their value, yet the same rule does not apply to family farms unless they are valued at over $244 million? Why is it that for developed commercial real estate that is heritage listed a $5 million threshold applies, yet it would seem that for heritage listed agricultural properties the threshold is $244 million? Why is it that new forestry plantations require notification to the Foreign Investment Review Board, yet existing forestry plantations, below the $244 million threshold, do not? Why is it that a foreigner must apply for approval to the Foreign Investment Review Board to buy a one-bedroom unit, yet they are required to do nothing if they purchase agricultural land valued at $220 million?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely it is time to fix these anomalies. Surely it is time that all land was treated equally by the Foreign Investment Review Board. Surely it is time for the national interest test to be applied without discrimination to all parts of Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:29</span>):  In the time available I will try to make the important points on an announcement that was made late last week by Westpac that over 500 jobs were to be axed. Many of these jobs were to be in South Australia, in my electorate—in the suburb of Lockleys, which has one of the largest Westpac call centres in Australia. Out of the 560 jobs that are going to be axed across the nation, 150 will be sent offshore to places like India, where a lot of the backroom work is being done. This is after Westpac announced more than $6 billion in record profits last year and paid their top executive close to $10 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about survival or about a business that is not doing well; this is about making more megaprofits than are already being made. The call centre at Lockleys had a lot of state government support and money put into it so that it could come to South Australia in the mid 1990s. Back then it was set up by Westpac and it was called The Mortgage Centre. It employed 1,400 people. Today, as a result of these announcements being made intermittently, over periods of time, there are fewer than 900 workers working there. What is even more ironic is that the workers have been asked to train their overseas replacements, who have been flown to Australia—under what visa I do not know—and then the workers lose their jobs. It is like asking someone to dig a grave and then jump into it. You can see how upset these workers would be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also feel deeply for those workers who are being forced to train their counterparts and then be sacked. I am very pleased that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has undertaken to investigate how these workers are securing visas to Australia and to ensure that they are not circumventing the intentions of our skilled worker program. As I said, this is akin to being asked to dig your own grave. It is very insulting and very unfair for those workers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had a huge amount of feedback from the electorate about this issue, and the message is unequivocal: we want Australian companies to employ people here in Australia and keep the jobs here. Despite this, many Australian owned companies, like banks and telecommunication companies, continue to busily recruit foreign labour to do these jobs overseas. Anyone who has had cause to deal with some of these companies by phone in recent years has probably noticed it. You would probably—not unreasonably—have  questioned why this work cannot be done in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The short answer is that it can be done here in Australia. Our top four banks—Westpac, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ and NAB—are among some of the biggest in the world by market capitalisation. Last year they announced record megaprofits of more than $24 billion. There is nothing wrong with that; it is fantastic that they have megaprofits. At the same time, I think they have a duty to the community and the country that they are in. Crying poor is no excuse. It is not the role of the government to tell private companies how to run their businesses. People cannot stop them from sending jobs overseas if that is what they want to do. They are free enterprises. But I think it is important to let the consumer know, at the point of transaction or the point of business, that their information and the transaction they are signing up to is all going to go overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have 'Made in Australia' products for those consumers who want to purchase Australian goods. I cannot see why we cannot have the same thing in the service industry, so the consumer can choose which company they want to do business with. I can tell you now that a lot of Australian consumers would choose the companies that keep the jobs here in Australia and do not offshore their work to workers overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This could be done simply through a logo, just as we have with the 'Made in Australia' logo. People have the ability to choose a product that is made in Australia. We should give them the same choice for the service industry. The logo could be applied to companies who choose to employ their workforce entirely in Australia and similarly support local Australian economies with those jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such a certification would give consumers information, certainty and choice when making decisions about services they use. That is currently not available. Right now, if you sign up for a new bank account, insurance policy or telephone account, no-one tells you that your private information could go overseas to be processed by an employee who has taken an Australian job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With an 'Australian operated' logo, many people in the local community—workers, customers and families—could choose to support the local economy and keep our economy strong. It is not unreasonable for customers to presume that an Australian owned company is operating from within Australia, yet that is not currently the case. I call on Westpac to think carefully about the offshoring of these jobs and the impact that has on those workers in my electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) I (Mr Rudd) can confirm that Senegal severed diplomatic relations with Iran on 23 February 2011 and that these relations have not since been restored. A communiqué of the Senegalese Council of Ministers Meeting of 24 February 2011 stated that the President of Senegal condemned Iran's involvement and responsibility in the killing of Senegalese soldiers, through the supply of arms and munitions to rebels in the South Casamance region of Senegal. The communiqué stated that the Senegalese army's ballistics expert had proven that munitions used against the Senegalese soldiers were of Iranian origin. DFAT is not aware of any reference to arms shipments through Nigeria in any statements on the matter by the Government of Senegal. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr Albanese:</span>
                  </a>  The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands the importance of mobile telephony to Australians. In recent years the mobile phone carriers have significantly expanded their terrestrial mobile networks. Vodafone Hutchison Australia claims its networks currently cover more than 94 per cent of the Australian population. Optus claims its 3G network provides services to 97 per cent of the Australian population. Telstra claims its Next G network now provides mobile coverage to 99 per cent of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For the most part the recent extension of mobile coverage across Australia has been based on commercial decisions by carriers. In making a decision to extend coverage to a particular area, carriers will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Telstra is the only carrier that provides mobile telephony in the Charters Towers district. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy sought advice from Telstra in regard to mobile coverage on the McEwen Highway between Charters Towers and Ravenshoe. Telstra advised they have on numerous occasions looked at the feasibility of providing coverage to this area. However, they have determined that it is not commercially viable to do so. Telstra also advised they will continue to review investment decisions as part of their ongoing network planning. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In areas that are sparsely populated or have little passing traffic, often the only commercially viable option for mobile phone services is via satellite. Unlike terrestrial mobile coverage, satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and population, and are available from a number of providers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme improves the affordability of mobile communications for people living and working in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, by providing subsidies for the purchase of satellite phone handsets. The scheme provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage or up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend more than 180 days across a two year period in non-coverage areas. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Under the scheme's rules, those eligible to apply include individuals, small businesses, community groups, not-for-profit organisations, Indigenous corporations, emergency service organisations, health organisations and educational institutions.

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) In 2009 Australia committed USD $30.405 million (AUD $43.105 million) to participate in the Technology Development phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. It is important to note that no contribution or commitment has been made by Australia to enter the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) This investment has allowed valuable insights and knowledge into the US program, three Australians to work inside the US Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Product Office, the opportunity for the Capability Development Group to refine requirements and for reliability, user and survivability testing to occur here in Australia. All this will directly support future stages of this project. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) With specific reference to the United States Market, Thales (Australian Defence Industries at the time) endeavoured to enter the US market with the Bushmaster via a commercial partnering arrangement. The Department of Defence provided support to Thales in this process, including facilitation provided by the Defence Export Unit, and by providing original Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle requirements documentation to the US Government. In addition 'Team Australia', an Australian Government initiative where DMO joined with Australia's defence industry to showcase Australian defence capability solutions, promoted the Bushmaster at the Association of US Army (AUSA) Conference. To date there has been no success.</span>

                  </a>  The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) NBN Co has not yet indicated dates for the fibre network rollout in the electorate of Forrest. However, NBN Co has now released its first 12-month national rollout schedule. The rollout schedule will be updated each quarter to include new locations and is available on NBN Co's website. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co plans to complete the rollout of its fixed wireless network, including to some communities in the Forrest electorate, by 2015. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 July 2011, NBN Co launched its Interim Satellite Service (ISS) which offers improved broadband services to eligible users in regional areas, ahead of the introduction of a long term satellite solution in 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Indicative coverage maps published by NBN Co suggest that Augusta, Bunbury, Busselton, Capel, Collie, Donnybrook, Dunsborough, Harvey, Margaret River, Nannup and Yarloop may be served by fibre to the premises technology. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co's maps indicate that the towns of Boyanup and Cowaramup may be served by next generation fixed wireless technology providing speeds of 12 megabits per second (Mbps).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All remaining premises will be served by next-generation satellite technology providing speeds of 12 Mbps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These maps are indicative only and the precise optic fibre footprint will only be known when NBN Co completes its detailed suburb-by-suburb, region-by-region designs for the network. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) NBN Co's current network planning for the fibre footprint includes the assumption that, where transit backhaul passes communities with greater than 500 premises, the fibre footprint may be extended to cover these communities. Under these current network planning guidelines no community with less than 500 premises, even if passed by the fibre transit backhaul routes, will be connected to fibre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) NBN Co's detailed expenditure forecasts for cost to pass particular premises are commercial-in-confidence. Information on the expenditure associated with the rollout can be found in NBN Co's Corporate Plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) NBN Co offers a wholesale-only service, and monthly retail costs are a matter for retail service providers. However, prices for NBN plans released to date compare very favourably to existing ADSL plans, while delivering a superior end user experience and the option to upgrade to faster speeds not available over the copper network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For example, Exetel has announced NBN plans starting from $34.50 for a 12 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload service with 20 gigabyte (GB) data allowance. iiNet has announced NBN plans starting from $49.95 per month for a 12 Mbps service with 40 GB of data allowance. Retail service providers also offer a range of plans with significantly higher speeds and data allowances for interested customers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, there is no additional line rental fee with NBN services, as typically charged by retailers for an ADSL service. Service providers such as Exetel and Internode provide a phone service at no extra charge with their broadband plans, and iiNet offers a phone service for an additional $9.95 per month with their broadband plans that includes free local and national calls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government expects that retail service providers will continue to announce competitive NBN pricing plans in the coming months.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The focus of Australian Government recognition of Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee will be support for and involvement with the "Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust ". As jointly announced by Prime Minister Cameron and me during CHOGM in Perth on 28 October 20 II, Buckingham Palace has agreed to the creation of the Trust, which will be chaired by former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK), Sir John Major.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Both Prime Minister Cameron and I also encourage individuals and businesses across the Commonwealth to mark the Jubilee by supporting the Trust in their own way.
